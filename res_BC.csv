Why? It is a totally unique place which incorporates the beauty of the desert. I love the way it is laid out, in a very spacious way, in a spectacular setting. During my most recent visit, I realized how it acquired its name as we watched the magnificent sunset over the Tucson Mountains and the twinkling stars start to appear from our room balcony. The common areas of the hotel are lovely, and were updated maybe about ten years ago. The room I stayed in had been updated recently and the bathroom was very nice with a luxury walk-in shower. I do wish the grounds were in better shape-- they are well-kept and beautiful but many places are in need of refurbishment. I'm just afraid if the place gets refurbished it will lose its unique character and charm. That being said, it would be wonderful to see some items changed-- carpeting on the external stairs needs replacing, the sliding glass doors need to be replaced in the rooms, etc. I could choose to stay in a new, perfectly situated but soul-less spot at hotel down the street-- one that looks the same as every other one in any other town. This hotel bills itself as ""the soul of the Southwest"" and indeed it is the soul of Tucson at least. Enjoy it while you still can.",2021-05-25 19:14:06 UTC,4,0,0,0,SqRIklmBp6UkRfR97DUxCw

Besides the view that was supplied by the grand nature of things, there is not much to say about the nature of service here. As we checked in we were greeted with frowns borrowed from the Great Depression and the smell of rotted bacon. Not even the jazz music could save the serenade of the damned here. The blazing heat outside at a whopping 110 degrees you'd think they'd have at least one complimentary bottle of water in the room. Instead you are given the option of purchasing a 20 ounce bottle of water for $5. At the Wyndham breakfast establishment it took nearly 25 min until we decided to not wait any longer for a server to help us.

Be aware that it's like $30 a night; that's pretty much normal Philly prices but whew! However, it's also steps away from a large metro stop so maybe you wanna leave your car in the suburbs, just saying.

The hotel itself is quirky and cute. The beds are soft and cushy and I slept really well; the pillows were perfect. The bathrooms were nice and the water pressure was excellent. Weirdly, our bathroom had no towel bars or hooks whatsoever. But I'm not Martha Stewart so I just hung my towel on a chair.

Jazz Parlor is also a very good conventional escape room while Smuggler's Den is quite experimental and weird.

We booked two rooms at this hotel, one for my wife and I, and one for our 18-year-old son. We checked in around midnight and as we were walking to our room, it was hard not to notice the prostitutes and shady characters roaming the halls. They seemed to be watching our every move. When we got to our first (non-smoking) room, we opened the door and it felt like the morning after a Saturday night at a smoky pool hall. I immediately felt like I needed to shower. We also found stains on the sheets and holes in the wall. On to our son's (non-smoking) room.... Exact same experience, smoke-infested, poorly maintained room! We told him to stay in the room and do not answer the door no matter what. Sure enough, within 10 minutes of dropping him off, he had two separate knocks on his door. He called to tell us this and he also mentioned he was having a hard time breathing due to his asthma and the room smelling like smoke. After deliberation, we decided to leave this hotel due to safety and health concerns. We went to the front desk and they told us they understood and they would refund one of the rooms but we need to talk to the manager when they came on duty about a refund for the second. They said given the asthmatic condition, they believed we would get our money back. We left this hotel and went to another hotel not too far away.

Fast forward to regular business hours and us calling the manager to discuss the refund. She said she would not give us a refund because she watched the video surveillance and we wound up staying in one of the rooms. This was a complete and utter lie and we called her out on it. We asked her to show us the video and she got very snippy and told us we are not getting a refund.

Location, Location, Location
Ok, so this WAS great!  This is the best place in town for location, as far as I'm concerned.  Seemingly everything is within walking distance!  Hotel Congress is the only other place with such fantastic location, but I hear it's super noisy there due to their night club that runs 'til 2am (not the case with Covid, though)  

No problems with noise at the AC Marriott, though.

The pool area is nice, but the bar area is closed (hello, Covid).  

They have a real, honest-to-goodness Peloton in the fitness center.  In fact, I think they have two when Covid doesn't require so much separation of equipment.  So bring your shorts and shoes if the weather isn't to your liking for hiking.  I wish more hotel had this in their fitness centers.

Rooms are well appointed, very new, and the HVAC is one of the best you could ask for.

Parking is on site and is $20 a day for self park with in-and-out privileges.  This is a super convenient place to park, so we bit the $20/day bullet due to lack of anything better.

The restaurant and bar area are only open for breakfast or dinner on weekends.  We only ate breakfast there once and it did not please.  I'm glad I have enough status where that didn't cost me anything because paying for it would have been seriously disappointing.  There's only three items to choose from and each tasted like it was highly processed, microwaved food.  Our server was the only person working, so everything took a long time.  Coffee was over-brewed, too, so I went back to the room to get another cup instead of asking for a second in the restaurant.

But... It's Covid, so a break will be given at this time.  We'll be back to Tucson and will stay here unless we get a rental place downtown.",2021-02-20 20:56:03 UTC,3,0,0,1,W87b8hlaJXrJlHtv1crYIw

I arrived an hour prior to the flight. Allegiant policy is that they begin boarding 45 minutes prior to a flight. I was told that the door was already closed and if there was no further boarding. Then they argued with me about my husband being on military orders in the military discount. I called previously the night before, and was told since he's on orders if I brought a copy of them it would be fine. Apparently was not fine. Rather than discussing paying for the bags there was no point... They disregarded the 45 minute pre-boarding procedure, and had already boarded the flight and shut the door. When I asked to speak to a manager I got the pleasant surprise that it was Diana. Do not fly allegiant if you have somewhere to be at a particular time, since at the Clearwater Saint Pete airport they disregard the companies boarding procedure.",2021-04-24 01:17:18 UTC,1,0,0,1,W8RWGlxocbB_qql_bWLBGg

Upon arrival we noticed the customer service was not great they were very unwelcoming.  

After checking into our rooms the hotel towels had obvious stains on them we requested better towels but to be honest they were all the same.  My bed had dust on it and it clearly showed that the linens was not changed from the last guest. I was very afraid to sit or lay in the bed.  I requested my bed be made up with fresh linens and was told I would have to pay 100.00 dollars extra for housekeeping to do that.

In the second room that was booked we found a used child juice packet from the previous guest under the covers  and also dirty sheets and pillowcases.  We complained to the front desk and all we were met with was absolute rudeness and indifference to our complaints and concerns for our health in this hotel especially with covid still plaguing society. 

When we requested a manager we were told no managers is onsite so we cannot speak to anyone and I may add we were dismissed immediately by the front desk staff. 

Two nights of stay is definitely two night of hell. 

The hotel is a nice hotel with great location however the management NEEDS TO GO!!! They also need to purchase better quality hotel linens and a better company to wash the linens to remove stains. Clean towels, sheets etc all had some type of stains. It's very unsettling to use this hotel linens.

However most of them are pretty mainstream. If you are used to the fancy stuff at the regular location in the back room, you won't find it here. I've eaten here once or twice and it wasn't memorable but it was ok.

I had a Travelzoo voucher I purchased that let us stay in a Junior Executive Corner Suite with City View (thanks COVID) for $99/night. We booked 3 nights using 2 vouchers and it was worth every penny. We arrived right around check-in time and the concierge didn't have us checking in until the following day which was incorrect. I had the correct dates in my Marriott app and she was able to check us in. We were supposed to get free water with our stay because I am a Marriott Bonvoy member. We only got free water when we requested it at the desk and not inside the room. 

The room itself was spacious and was a two-room split floor plan with 1.5 bathrooms. It was nice to have 2 bathrooms if you need it while getting ready. The extra living room area had a flat screen TV, couch, lamps, another cooler, lounge chair, table with chairs, and coffee table. The bedroom had a king-sized bed, lounge chair, mini bar, cooler, flat screen TV, and lamps. It was really nice for what we paid. It was also relatively clean but maybe because it was a suite. We felt that the bed was sort of lumpy and have stayed at places with better beds. 

There is a gym and pool on the 4th floor. The gym opens at 7 am although not necessarily on the dot. It's supposed to be 24-hr but due to COVID, it's operating at reduced hours. I waited there one day with another guest and she had to call down a few times before someone came up to unlock the door. 

There was no included breakfast but you could purchase items from the breakfast bar if you needed a quick bite. They had that in the mornings for a short time. Otherwise, we left to get breakfast elsewhere which was preferable. The property's restaurants were closed during our stay due to the pandemic. 

We barely saw the housekeeping crew throughout our stay. We put the sign out to preserve our privacy so we weren't bothered. If we needed anything, we went down to the front desk to ask about it. They had a busy valet as the hotel was close to the convention center. We saw different groups come in for conventions during our stay. 

Le Meridien is located close to Canal, walking distance to Bourbon, the Audubon Aquarium, and the Harrah's Casino & Harrah's Hotel. The convention center was also walking distance. 

Our stay was mostly uneventful and we had a really nice time at Le Meridien. I definitely recommend getting a deal to reduce the price of the stay.",2021-11-11 15:56:18 UTC,4,6,3,6,-NU54jLC4Zf88jm7bZu4gQ

They do have outside music but it can't be placed too high because it runs through the whole hotel.  Antonio offered to go home and get me a speaker for my phone which was very thoughtful.

The flight going up was fine, we were delayed leaving because of lightning, but not Allegiant's fault.
The flight coming home was not good! After being delayed about 25 minutes, we finally got on the plane and the flight attendant made the usual speech about ""Welcome to Allegiant, blah, blah, blah. IF THERE'S ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO MAKE YOUR FLIGHT MORE COMFORTABLE, PLEASE ASK ONE OF YOUR FLIGHT ATTENDANTS!""
So, I asked the nearest flight attendant who was walking towards me down the aisle, ""Excuse me, what time will we arrive in Clearwater?"" (so I could call my ride and let them know!) The flight attendant (Cynthia) snapped back at me ""I'M COUNTING!!!""
Well, excuse ME! I had no idea she was SILENTLY COUNTING TO HERSELF!!! Her colleague just announced over the P.A. system ""IF THERE'S ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO MAKE YOUR FLIGHT MORE COMFORTABLE, PLEASE ASK ONE OF YOUR FLIGHT ATTENDANTS!""
Maybe CYNTHIA didn't hear this. Maybe CYNTHIA was having a bad day. Maybe CYNTHIA just had a fight with her boyfriend/husband/whatever. Maybe CYNTHIA wasn't feeling well. MAYBE CYNTHIA SHOULDN'T BE WORKING IN CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!
So I asked a different flight attendant ""Excuse me, what time will we arrive in Clearwater?"" and she politely said ""2 hours and 47 minutes, I'll have to calculate what time that is."", and she walked away. Never coming back to tell me, her customer, what ACTUAL TIME we would be landing. Now I know I can figure out the time, but this just shows the COMPLETE LACK OF CUSTOMER SERVICE AT Allegiant Airlines!
The pilot never came on the P.A. and made the customary speech about when we would arrive, weather conditions, sit back and enjoy, blah, blah, blah.
About 1 hour into the flight, flight attendant CYNTHIA came up to the front of the plane to heat up some food (which smelled VILE!!!) and as she walked past me she stopped and said ""Excuse me, what are listening to?""
I said ""It's a radio"" (I was using earbuds, not disturbing anybody)
CYNTHIA said "" I don't FEEL COMFORTABLE with you using that, please put it away!""
I said ""It's just an AM/FM radio.""
CYNTHIA  parroted the line ""Well, it's possible that it could INTERFERE with the planes navigation system, so I need you to stop using it.""
I turned off the radio and said "" It's only a receiver, it can't interfere with anything.""
CYNTHIA again told me it made HER UNCOMFORTABLE.
I put the little AM/FM radio away and said ""I guess you're mad because I asked you what time we would be arriving in Clearwater.""
CYNTHIA said ,""Well, I WAS COUNTING!""
I said ""Well, I guess you're getting even with me for asking.""
CYNTHIA  smiled an evil smile and said ""No sir, that's not it."" and she walked away to eat her food.
AM/FM radio signals would make the sky glow if human beings could see them. There are THOUSANDS of AM/FM radio stations across America and the world. THEY DO NOT INTERFERE WITH AIRLINE NAVIGATION!!!
THEY DO NOT INTERFERE WITH AIRLINE NAVIGATION!!!
These signals are in the air 24 hours per day, 365 days a year, WETHER I AM LISTENING TO THEM OR NOT!!!
My little Radio Shack AM/FM pocket radio does not, CAN NOT, BROADCAST OR CREATE ANY TYPE OF RADIO SIGNAL!!!
However, the old lady sitting in the same row as me who kept trying to get a cell phone signal so she could SEND, i.e. TRANSMIT the pictures she was taking out the window to her son, THAT DID NOT BOTHER CYNTHIA AT ALL!!!
If Allegiant's flight attendants are so ignorant that they don't know this (Cynthia in particular!!!) then maybe they should not be empowered to enforce safety rules that THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND!!!
So CYNTHIA is a power hungry B****h, who likes to bully people (maybe men in particular) on her flights to and from St. Pete.
Maybe she is an unhappy person, maybe her man mis-treats her at home so she takes it out on other men she sees. Maybe she just shouldn't work with the public. But she ruined my experience on Allegiant and I will be posting this everywhere possible on the internet.
Also, the captain had the SEATBELT light on for almost the entire 3 hour flight. But yet the flight attendants were up and walking. Sometimes selling drinks and snacks, sometimes just wandering around chatting with each other. It seems to me that it is either SAFE or UNSAFE to be unbuckled and moving around for both the customers and flight attendants.",2021-08-17 19:06:02 UTC,1,0,1,0,0_V2vXJKaBSj0rTRYEUoBg

My friends and I stayed at this hotel from 9/9-9/12 in room 317. First, on 9/10 there was a random man that entered our room while we were getting ready. While we were a bit stunned, the man quickly left the room once he saw we were in there so we let it slide. Second, a few days after returning home from our trip I started noticing little bites on my stomach/back area. I reached out to my friends who confirmed they also had the same bites meaning these were the result of bed bugs. My immediate thought was to call the hotel to let them know about the room so that it can be cleaned before anyone else stays in it. The person I spoke with from the hotel was extremely dismissive and in no way sympathetic towards our experience. This person also informed me that I should just call back again during the week as they don't have any managers that work at the hotel on the weekends. I found that odd and after questioning it, this person turned sarcastic/rude and ended up hanging up on me. I was shocked by this behavior as I did not feel I was being unreasonable with what I was calling about. I turned to corporate to file a complaint and was told I should be receiving a call from the hotel within a week. Well it has now been several weeks with no phone call/follow up.

My girlfriends and I decided to visit to celebrate a 30th birthday. We started the day off at the spa with mani/pedis. With only 2 nail techs, our appointments were staggered but it gave us each time to enjoy the amenities (sauna, steam room and whirlpool). The towel rack and shoes were stocked along with feminine products. My only complaint is we did not readily have access to robes and when I asked the woman at the front desk for some, she said they were being laundered only to bring me some a few moments later. My nail tech was Mary and I thoroughly enjoyed my services with her. The exfoliation, lotion massages and hot towels were enough to put me to sleep. I did receive a $10 discount for getting a mani/pedi but I would still say the services are somewhat overpriced for the quality of the polish itself (missing some spots on my nail and a girlfriends acrylic had air bubbles). 

The pool was busy but we were still able to find chairs. There were some pesky ducks trying to turn the pool into their pond, which some guests didn't enjoy. I found it humorous. The food was fresh and fast. I think my salad was the enchilada and if you enjoy spicy foods, I highly recommend it. The frosé was strong and refreshing. They do have cups and water set out which is much needed during 100 degree days.

With the change in CDC recommendations, hardly any guests were wearing masks. Staff in the spa, at the front desk and bar did though.

My stay at The Warwick was awful. The lobby was very nice......but the room was outdated and run down. 
We walked into a room that had a saturated floor (I mean it ""squished"" when we stepped on it!), so I went to call the front desk and the phone was what I believed to be dead. I later found out that if the front desk is busy, you are met with completely dead air--no sound at all. Like, who is suppose to know this?!?  It only makes sense to play music or have a prerecorded message stating that you're on hold to begin with!  Doesn't make sense. 
So I went downstairs to notify them of all the water on the floor. 
Next, the room. As I looked around, I was tremendously disappointed--the furniture was scratched, bubbled and broken (one bed had a large crack running through the side rail that looked like it was glued back together. 
Same in the bathroom, except now I saw the door was rusty and the paint was bubbling. The shower had mildew--not the kind that can be cleaned--the type that you need to recaulk. 
I was upset--we were stuck here for TWO nights and we were grossed out so badly that I FAR would have preferred sleeping in my CLEAN home!  
Hands down, if I could have backed out at any point during our stay, I would have and then checked into another hotel. In a heartbeat. 
That's really sad. We decided we wouldn't stay in a ""name brand"" hotel....that it'd be fun to stay in a hotel that looked so pretty in the pictures that were probably taken YEARS ago!  I've stayed in a Super 8 motel that was nicer than this one--and that's no exaggeration. 
We were hungry and decided to try the ""highly rated"" in-house steakhouse called The Grille. 
First, when we walked in, there wasn't another soul around except for the man standing behind the maitre d NEVER ONCE LOOKED UP AT US (he was looking at his phone).  I awkwardly cleared my throat hoping for any recognition that we were standing there--nothing. I then asked if we could order a meal for take out. He looked up (for the first time) said ""yes you can order take out""--and STUCK HIS NOSE BACK IN HIS PHONE--and never helped us AT ALL until a waiter passed by and he snapped his finger at him and told him to take our order. We were standing there a good 10 minutes feeling like we were ghosts!  It's like we didn't stand there for about 15 minutes waiting for ANY assistance in placing an order for 2 people that cost $180!  
The food: the lobster bisque was to die for, my prime rib was medium rare at best when I ordered medium well.  To me, inedible. Too much blood. I decided to just eat around the circumference of the meat leaving about 2/3 to be thrown away--there was absolutely NO way I was going back down to that restaurant--I had already been made to feel entirely awkward and obsolete. The salmon was good. The vegetable sides were okay--a little overdone. The key lime pie was good. 
But I never would have spent $180 for a meal for two on a ""good/okay"".  
Perhaps the worst part was rolling the chair out from the desk only to find a large, white stain in the middle of the chair. I'm no forensic detective--and I didn't need to be to figure out what it probably was. 
I thought I'd literally vomit. 
Went to watch tv and the sound was terrible--muffled. 
Gave up and went to bed. 
The next morning, I stepped out of bed to a large wet spot on the floor where my feet ""squished"" on it again. 
I had to go to the front desk again to ask that they please fix the radiator again. We went out and when we returned, the spot was cleaned up and the HEAT was cranked!  We just walked around for hours in 99-degree weather and were exhausted--only to walk into a HOT hotel room. 
The staff was hot or cold. Housekeeping was wonderful--always smiling with a nice ""hello, how are you today""?  The bell boys were very nice and friendly too. 
For the most part, reception was okay. Twice we were met, again, with a front desk person on the phone (company phone) who wouldn't so much as look up until they were off the phone. No finger held up as an indicator ""I'll be right with you"" or even a small smile and eye contact to acknowledge your existence. I don't know if that's a rule at this hotel!  Don't so much as look at a guest until you're ready to help them or what!  (That's sarcasm.)
All in all, I wouldn't have stayed in this hotel for half the price. Speaking of prices, I was overcharged for a room--contacted them twice about it--and they haven't refunded my money!"" How's that for the cherry on the sh!t sundae?!",2021-08-25 12:30:09 UTC,1,0,0,0,m9foFsG0-hbljhc6qK2bBw

Pre-pandemic, I loved flying Allegiant. It is the only airline that has nonstops to some of the places I travel to the most. Sure, the seats are as minimally padded as possible, every thing costs extra but the convenience was well worth it. 

I had two trips cancelled during the pandemic, and good on Allegiant for issuing me credit that lasted a really long time. It was easy to redeem, too. I also appreciate that Military can check two bags free. That's where the happiness ends.

I've flown Allegiant two round trips in the last four months and it is really pretty terrible. First trip, both flights were delayed. Both flights were FULL. Both flights were at a horrible, cramped, gate area where mask requirements were an unfulfilled wish. The flight crews did not enforce mask wearing. Ugh. 

This latest trip, I fully expected frustrations. It was Thanksgiving weekend, people and their dumb selves would be everywhere. And they were. Our flight out of St Pete....was delayed. The gate was crowded. The flight itself was like riding a bus. The 'tray' was the size of an ipad mini. Our return flight....was delayed. And delayed again. And again. And again. A three hour delay in a windowless, cramped gate area with no plugs for charging. Literally the only gate in the terminal with those qualities. Updates were uninformative. Passengers grew tired of masking. FINALLY we boarded. An hour later we were still sitting there with the plane door open. 

The copilot did not properly wear his mask. One of the FA's did not properly wear her mask. 

In good news, we got all our luggage, but lost most of our day due to this nonsense. 100% of the four flights I've taken since this summer with Allegiant have been delayed. I will not fly them again.

First off, we had booked through a third party app that did not allow us to select how many people were in our party so we are automatically given a basic king bedroom by the hotel. The hotel front desk associate said that was part of the deal/discount by using that app and that there were no rooms available. Only until my husband had to press further, Oh really? You have no rooms after the weekend of graduation, on a Sunday evening? that he switched his gears and said, ""let me work some of my magic"" and believe it or not, a room magically became available...

My husband tipped him anyway (bless his generous heart) and the guy didn't even bother to tell us that the only way you can access the garage is through the 3rd floor exit door at the end of the hallway to the left. And that you can only go in the garage from the building, but you can't get back IN THE BUILDING because the door locks. You have to walk outside to the front entrance just to go back to your room... we thank the lady who works on the resident side of Aerston for explaining that to us.

Not only that, but he failed to mention that you have to always come back to the front desk to check in with your parking ticket EVERY time you go out so that it gets billed to the room. 

Then when we went upstairs, the TV didn't work. We called the front desk and he said apparently there's a magic trick to this too. You have to press channel up twice or something... and then it worked.

We stayed there for 2 nights and it was comfortable. The showers were really nice and spacious and we loved their boutique soaps. On the third night we tried out Loews and didn't like it so we ended up back at the Aerston. This time, we got a guy who was EXCEPTIONAL. Great service, informed us of EVERYTHING, even went so far as to give us the tip that if you park on the 6th/7th floor of the structure (I forget, inquire with the desk) that you can get in and out of the building from there. That's also the floor where you can take your pets out. 

Overall, great stay aside from that one second rate staff member. This is an autograph collection hotel and their hotels are always designed top notch. I stayed at the Kimpton in SF which wasn't Autograph and it was incredibly disappointing... Anyway, definitely stay here if you can! It's beautiful and in a great location.

yBani53UgROCin6DNNlzoQ,National Car Rental,"Hotels & Travel, Car Rental",Tampa,27.962934,-82.534716,4,237,AZ,"I recently rented a car from Asheville with the intention of returning it to Asheville a few days later. I had a family emergency come up and was unable to take my originally planned flight. I was able to change the date of return to the next day on the National app, but was unable to change the drop off location. I googled if it was ok to return to a different location and the website stated that it is permissable to do it but you would have to pay mileage. Because I had been a customer of National for over a decade and always had good experiences, I didn't think it would be an unreasonable amount.

Upon returning the car in Tampa, I learned that my bill was 5 times the original amount ($250 to $1383).

I spoke with the manager in Tampa at the time. I let him know that I would rather extend the rental by another day and drive the car back to Asheville for $30 more. He let me know if I emailed the Asheville location that they would never charge me the full amount and not to drive it back because he needed the car in Tampa.

I emailed the manager, never heard back. I called the customer service line, they escalated to that manager again, never heard back. I called a 3rd time and someone stated that the manager had made notes that the amount was fair and he/she wasn't going to change it, but he/she never called or emailed me to discuss. It was then supposed to be escalated to an area manager, I waited again for another 2 days. I just called again today and asked to have it escalated again.

I was able to speak with Chad from the escalation team. He stated there wasn't anything that he could do and the amount would stick. When I said I was disappointed and National would be losing a loyal customer, he wished me well and then hung up on me.

This is not the National Car Rental that I have been telling my friends and family about for years. This is not the experience that I have had in the past. I am really sad to know that I am discard-able as a customer. My tone about the company will definitely have a different ring to it in the future due to this sequence of events.",2021-02-24 21:54:09 UTC,1,0,0,1,BbjTSBOqE581NggpyBnhIg

This place is dirty, stinky, runned down, and downright nasty!  

I got to this hotel in the late afternoon and the only upside of this place was that the lady at the front desk was very kind and accommodating. I got my room key and took the elevator which had multiple pieces of trash laying on the floor. I got to my room and I had to use all my strength to get the door open. There was a dent in the door and it looks like someone tried to break in and ended up breaking the door! When I got into the room I noticed the floors were sticky and it was quite drafty in my room. I looked in the bedroom area and housekeeping must've left the window open! There were about 7-8 flies flying around in my room! I immediately shut the window and started trying to kill them, but it proved too hard to continue. So I sat on the couch for a while before going out for dinner. After dinner I came back and thought maybe it would be nice to take a dip in the hot tub. I got changed and went down only to find the pool area closes at 9! What kind of pool area closes at 9pm and does nothing open again until 10am!? Infuriated, I stormed back up to my room and decided to get ready for bed. I opened the dresser under my bed to find a coffee cup filled halfway with water, just sitting in there! Gross! I got in bed after a thorough inspection to make sure there wasn't any bugs, because at this point I wouldn't be surprised if a couple roaches were hiding in the sheets, and lay down on what felt like a mattress that has been around since before the internet! I looked over to realize my clock wasn't working, so I had to use my phone as a clock. I watched some tv before going to bed, and when I finally turned off the tv for the night, I could very clearly hear the traffic on the highway near the hotel. I didn't get to sleep for hours as I heard trucks, cars, and semis plug by on the highway! In the morning I went down for breakfast and saw the same lady as the night before at the desk working. I thought this was really cruel and asked her about it. She told me that other than going home a few hours, she worked since at least 3pm the day before, and it was currently 9am. That really disgusts me that the hotel would let this poor young woman work all by herself for well over 12 hours! Shame on whoever owns this place for not keeping up the hotel and for letting the staff work from the previous afternoon all the way through the next morning with only a small break! Finally, the clientele here is questionable at best. There were kids as young as toddlers running in the halls when I got there with no supervision whatsoever!

To conclude, you are better off staying either on the other side of town, or at least at a different, better kept and better managed hotel! This place is darn awful and the only thing that's saving me from total rage was the extremely kind lady that works tirelessly to make sure the people are at least somewhat satisfied.

So this was no different and I was happy to find this mall while we were out and about in New Orleans. It didn't seem to have very many stores, but it had a J.Crew and an Anthropologie, and that was good enough for me. Unfortunately J crew was closed - there was a makeshift sign on the door that said ""I'll be back in 15 minutes"" or something like that. That was interesting, I guess only one person was working that day? 

Anyway I headed to Anthropologie, and I didn't see much, they didn't really have any good sales, so unfortunately I did leave this mall empty-handed but there were some other stores nearby where I found some items.

My in-laws spoiled us with dinner here! 

I understand they had a difficult time getting a reservation on the patio, though they happened to have a cancelation so we managed a seat with a nice view (although the patio was nearly empty when we sat down for our reservation).  The patio overlooks the golf course and resort and is beautiful at sunset. If you can't get a patio reservation, they do slide open the restaurant walls facing the patio on nice nights so you can sort of get that indoor/outdoor experience. 

The host was friendly upon arrival! Our waitress was good, except that she infrequently checked back on us and I'm pretty sure forgot about my drink order three times - it took about 40 minutes to get my second cocktail...  We had to check-in twice before I finally got the drink. This seems to be a common complaint here.

My family and I tried a number of the margarita options, which were all good. This seems to be their specialty. My husband ordered a kentucky mule which tasted like it was all ginger beer, no whiskey. 

The guacamole was good, though very salty. I shared a ceasar salad with my MIL, which ended up being a small side salad for each of us by the time we split it. We did really like how they roasted the romaine for the salad!

All of us ordered various main courses and agreed these were the best parts of the meal. The main courses change based on the season. I had the Ahi Tuna, which came with a fantastic sauce / greens. My husband had the ribs - boy oh boy was that a massive portion! Highly recommend getting a single rack unless you are splitting. 

Overall, the prices were high for the lack of excellent service, ok apps/drinks, and a dated restaurant appeal. The entrees are good, though!",2021-04-15 23:30:42 UTC,3,2,1,1,LToBhfZMB4LF6cDeZpRwBQ

Our trouble with the hotel began immediately following our stay. We departed the hotel the next morning after to spend some time with family in the Boise area. That evening while unpacking we realized we had left our clothes on hangers in the hotel closet by accident. I immediately called to let them know. I was told housekeeping was gone for the day but that someone would follow up with me in the morning.

When I received my call from housekeeping the next day they told me that the room had been cleaned but that no articles were found in the room or closet, and nothing was placed in lost and found. They asked for a description of the items which I gladly provided. I was told there were no items in the lost and found area that met that description, but that they would keep looking.

After calling to check in later that afternoon I received a call that they had found the items! So I rushed down to the hotel to retrieve them. They produced a laundry bag marked poorly with our room number in ball point pen and a vague story about how they found it.  Opening the bag up, it was only half of the items that were missing. The nicest of the clothing was absent including a wool coat, a silk dress from Salt X Pepper boutique we had purchased in downtown Boise prior to our trip, and a men's shirt. I immediately raised this to the attention of the front desk staff, who agreed that it was concerning and suspicious, but had no answers for me. They told me the people I needed to speak with were gone for the day. I took photos of the contents and left messages for them and began an agonizing process to resolve the situation.

When the head of security at the hotel reached out, I was told they would take this seriously, conduct a thorough investigation and file an insurance claim for the items. The internal investigation they conducted was quite lengthy and I did everything I could to be helpful. It was a long and time-consuming process, but the coat and dress were very important to my wife and we just wanted them back.

No report or particular details were shared with me about what they had discovered and the process ended with an impersonal email saying that the insurance didn't have enough proof to pay based on their investigation, and because of this the hotel was unable to do anything for me. Period. The End.

My requests for a follow up phone call have gone unanswered. I reached out to the front of house manager, and it was the first time she had ever heard about the situation, which shocked me. She was sympathetic but reiterated I needed to speak to the security investigator about it, whom has so far not responded to my request for more information and resolution. It seems they are avoiding the issue now.

No report was provided to me. No explanation was given as to who put those items of clothing in the bag in the first place. No explanation as to why protocol was not followed and these items were not immediately documented when the room was cleaned or taken to lost and found when they were discovered. No explanation for why half the clothing articles suddenly turned up after I persistently called about them or what happened to the still missing items. Nothing.

I used to travel frequently for business, and on the rare occasion I ever left something at a hotel I have been contacted immediately. This standard of care seems to be missing at the Grove, and the hotel's management of this incident has been painful and time-consuming to say the least. For your money, there are far better places to stay in downtown Boise these days.",2021-12-30 16:27:39 UTC,1,0,0,0,dB8E1K0QfSIA9UdjJrm6zg

The location is mighty convenient right in the heart of downtown Philadelphia. You're within walking distance of a lot of great restaurants and sites to see. 

The room was clean and the beds comfortable. Plus, the noise of the outside world was barely heard. 

The staff was nice and knowledgeable. The one who's checked us in gave us the name of a great place for cheesesteaks - that wasn't one of the famous ones everyone praises. 

Their mini store had some variety that was okay enough when looking for a snack. 

The bad: 
Valet parking for each night is $45. It is certainly not the worst deal I have come across (that's stil San Francisco at $65 a night), but it's still a bit steep. That's a minor quibble because it's expected in a big city, especially a touristy one like Philly. 

The website I found advertised daily breakfast. But when asked about this, the person behind the counter looked at me as if I had two heads. 

There was, attached to a hanger in the closet, a list of prices for laundry service. I had a question about it, so I asked the desk: again greeted by the look as if I had three heads. 

The prices in the mini store were astronomical. I know they mark things up, but it was out of hand. $6 for a frozen lean cuisine dinner is appalling. 

The only incident we encountered was a maid who tried to get in our room around 5:30 pm to clean because she mistakenly thought our room was empty. But that was taken care of easily enough and she was apologetic. I honestly didn't even get to see her face she backed out so quickly.",2021-07-11 12:49:31 UTC,3,3,2,4,wTgS6DPOLUU5_1JeSXVZJA

I chose to stay here as others have alluded as it is in the Marriott network and I needed just a few more nights to reach the next tier. First it is a pretty good deal. I had spent around $100 a night. I would say this is worth the money compared to other hotels. The Inn is very large and that is a plus as I felt like there was plenty of space and didn't run into other guests much. The Inn is older but my room looked like it had been completely renovated. There were no issues with paint and the bathroom, while rather small by modern standards was functional and clean. The only drawback with the rooms are and it would be a huge drawback, if you have four people in you family like I do, then you will have to share a twin bed as they dont have double Queen beds. However, the rooms are of decent size. The property does have free parking which is a plus versus the Gaylord Opryland across the street. They also have free coffee and its very good. There is a bus that will take you to the Gaylord across the street and to the mall as well as downtown. With the virus going on I cant comment on maid service but if you needed more towels or anything else they will just drop it off in your room.

It's a small motel and nobody is at the front desk in the middle of the night. So, at 2am when I woke up freezing and the heater didn't work, rather than try to find an employee to help me, I sat in my car with the heat on for half an hour then got all the extra blankets and tried going back to bed.

In the morning, I went to the front desk and asked if they knew how to fix the heater. They did not. I fiddled with it for a bit longer, and couldn't get it to work either - but at that point, I was checking out, what was I going to do.

When I left the Lavender Inn, I checked in with the front desk and let them know I hadn't been able to get the heater to work - but I did want to tell them what I learned: that it appeared to be the display wasn't working but it did power on. I thought maybe they could use this info to help fix it for the next guest. They asked if I had seen a remote control because sometimes the heater works with a remote. I had not. I asked them if they'd consider giving any discount considering the experience and they said they would ask management.

Later that afternoon, I got a call from the manager who told me they would give me a $50 credit (on a $315 room) and when I thanked him, he started telling me that it was really my fault for not telling them about the problem earlier. Which was... not what I was expecting.

This is a great hotel at a great price in a great location. These aren't usually 3 things you can say about the same property.

Besides my connectivity issues, everything was smooth. 

Parking is not free, so be prepared to valet or pay for the garage. It is connected to the hotel, so you can easily get from your room to the garage without any struggle.

The rooms are big, modern, and well taken care of. The hotel has a young feel to it, which is fun for the Nashville area. 

There is a little breakfast area downstairs, and it is attached the the XYZ Lounge. I didn't use these amenities, but they seemed to have all of the basics. 

From a location standpoint, you can walk or use a scooter to be right in the middle of Broadway in about a mile. This makes it very convenient to not have to deal with traffic and parking.

Maintenance came to our room, stayed in there for 45 minutes with us in there trying to fix. He ultimately says it cannot be repaired and we have to change rooms. Upon looking at the sheets closer as well, they were extremely dirty. Someone's pubic hairs were all over, crumbs, yellow stains. We go down to the front desk, the woman is not willing to do ANYTHING for us- no discount, no accommodation, NOTHING for having to switch rooms. We further explained how dirty the room was and she said it was probably from us and said VERBATIM ""this is what happens when people book the cheaper room through booking.com"". She also asked the maintenance guy if he saw our sheets and if we were telling the truth. There is a GLOBAL PANDEMIC , your rooms are FILTHY. We felt really uneasy about the idea of sleeping in someone else's sheets that were clearly not washed. We were shocked and the woman continued shaming us for booking indirectly and cheaper. As we tried to explain to her that this is awful service--and due to hot water, we have to change rooms--THERE SHOULD BE AN ACCOMMODATION. She stated she felt threatened by us and called the POLICE. Keep in mind this is the first night of our honeymoon. Cops come, and obviously determine we are respectful and civilized people, nothing happened at all and we went to the other room. We moved to the other room, it was slightly cleaner, and sheets were not terrible. Thankfully. We stayed the remainder of what we had booked, and we're getting dirty looks by the staff all other days. 

We were inconvenienced severely- hot water is a basic necessity in any hotel room. If it doesn't work and guests are forced to move, something should be done for them. AT LEAST an apology. 

Additionally, each time we had to visit the lobby, we heard the front desk telling everyone to NEVER book through booking.com.

We get to the new room and the key does not work. Back to the lobby we go. Staff is again very apologetic and this time comes with us to try the key. It does not work for him either. He uses his maser key to let us in. He tells us that he will send someone up in a minute and told us to stay in the suite. A different staff member comes upstairs and has us follow him to a third room. This time the key works and it appears to be clean.  The next we wake up only to find that the toilet does not flush.

We pack up our belongings and return to the lobby at 1 PM, at which time Bysheera tells us she will only refund us the remainder of a trip but will charge us for the night we stayed.

Loved the space in the rooms for the most part; includes a desk area, sink and counter space near the mini-fridge; but absolutely did not care for the small bath area; hardly enough room to turn around! Also, didn't like that the sink was in an open area outside of the toilet/shower space. Not gigantic deals though, specifically since we only stayed two nights. The staff and the cleanliness more than made up for my issue with the bathroom layout. :o) 

Masks requited indoors, which works for me! Social distancing requested.",2021-12-02 05:46:00 UTC,4,0,0,0,bGnb1xP6U3qmI9kIewxcxg

We didn't have a chance to try their food menu while passing through Tampa, but the food that came out looked good and on a different trip we were so horribly disappointed by the Burger 21 next door to Cigar City that they literally *could not* possibly do worse on the food front, and the beer is good so I'll take it on good faith that they have some nice offerings.
We popped in after landing as we waited for our ride and my brother ordered the Maduro Brown, while I went with the Fancy Papers Hazy IPA at our bartender's recommendation. Both were very good, and I've also had their Jai Alai IPA (if I've misspelled that, please forgive me, I didn't even pronounce it right the first time) and would recommend it as well. They also offer half-off shots when you buy a beer, so we had a pair of Knob Creek Ryes to get our time in Tampa started off right.
All the beer was good, the shot prices were good for airport prices (realizing that they're half off), and the service was friendly and prompt. We had a good time relaxing there and I bet you will, too.

One for me and one for my mom. I booked a King with a balcony. My mom didn't care about having a balcony, so just booked a King. 

Location: right at the ""front"" or ""start"" of bourbon street. It is off bourbon enough to not be right on it, but enough so that you will still get riff raft. I could hear street performers off my balcony. There is a Walgreens at the corner that is easy enough to walk to and a lot of close restaurants. 

Rooms: Bed was decent, not too hard not too soft. Room had a fridge that worked good enough to keep my drinks cool. Balcony connected with another room, but I never ran into anyone. Balcony's overlook the pool which is a square overlook to the pool. Water pressure:heat was good. They had a great blow dryer. A professional one vs standard crappy hotel blow dryers. My mom did not like that her room did not have a bathtub like mine and requested to be changed. She got changed on the 3rd day and her room was facing the outside street vs the pool and was up all night due to noise. 

Amenities: Did not use the gym. Pool was very nice to swim. It has a shallow area and deep end. My mom said the ladder was very hard for her to get in and out of. No stairs to get in the pool, only a ladder. Lots of chairs to lounge and pretty plants. Hotel restaurant open for breakfast and lunch and was amazing. Room service for us was offered on the 4th day.

Naturally I was hesitant after reading past reviews on Yelp, Google and trip advisor. I brought one of my good friends along with me, and thank goodness because this resort is huge...one can get lost and lonely.

We landed in Tucson on a Sunday, then ordered a Lyft to drive us 35mins to the resort. I hope an airport shuttle becomes available in the future. The ride into the resort was breathtaking! The grounds are absolutely stunning! Checkin was easy and quick. The front desk gave us a map of the property which listed fun activities:  hiking the resort trail, horseback riding etc. Our room was a long walk, so we took the resort shuttle to our room. 

(Not sure if you can request room numbers ahead of time, but if so, request building ""35"" room ""306"")

We absolutely loved our room! Upon entry we discovered a beautiful eucalyptus and grapefruit tree sitting outside our room. The balcony offered a PERFECT view of the pool and the mountains. Side note: I book a double Queen. Our room was spotless and smelled nice. The doors closed and locked perfectly, also the tv and phone worked. The beds were super comfortable! I got the best sleep ever. Our room came with a small refrigerator but no microwave (weird I know). 

There are plenty of shops and restaurants nearby. The resort shuttle runs from 3pm-8pm, with an 8mile radius. Trust me there's PLENTY TO Do Within the 8mile. I forgot one the shuttle drivers name, he very personable and informative. We seen him several times during our stay (if this helps he wears prescription glasses). Listen this place is short staffed like the rest of America so he shouldn't be hard to spot. Which speaking of! I applaud the Westward for their great service and positive energy. As I've mentioned this resort is short staffed....however, everyone is kind and works extremely hard. During my stay I walk the property a few times to admire the beautiful views and  plants. I didn't notice any trash during my walks.

My husband and I were celebrating our 26th wedding anniversary and we wanted to make it special since our 25th was spent in lockdown.

After a lovely lunch we got to the hotel about 1:30, knowing it was way to early but I wanted to get an idea of what was around. When we stopped in the hotel, Joel said it would be about an hour and a half & that housekeeping had just moved upstairs - great no worries; I had used the restroom in the lobby and it was disgusting yet I help out hope for the room, we wondered around, checked again at 2:30 'ish still not ready, needed to change clothes and use the bathroom, now told it would be 4pm which is check in time - we drove HOME to change. Went back to the hotel at 5PM and our room was STILL NOT READY!!!! Yet every room was full???? Not one person had checked into a king size room??? That was the question that made Joel yell at me and run out of the lobby!!

On our first night, 5/28/21 we were locked out of the front door around 11:30 PM with about five other occupants. Finally, as a guard came to unlock the door, two of the other occupants screamed at the guard for being locked outside ( might I add it was raining). On our second night, the folks staying next door to us we're on the elevator with us. When we got off the elevator and made our way to the room, the couple made a disparaging comment about us. I don't want to assume it was racially motivated, however our group compromised of three black women, they were not the same ethnicity. We went to dinner and came back at midnight to a noise complaint. We had only been back in the room 15 minutes. The guard from the night before, whom was very rude, told us they received numerous calls from neighbors regarding noise. After he left, we received a call from the night auditor saying if we did not quiet down, we would be asked to leave. While on the phone, we requested towels we had asked for hours prior to and never received. When the towels were delivered to our room, they sent two guards with the one hotel staff. This was extremely uncalled for as my friend was showering and we were making absolutely no noise. Might I add a group of gentlemen down the hall were blasting music and we didn't even have our tv on. At checkout on 5/30 we made a complaint to the manager at the front desk and she informed us numerous complaints were made about us the prior night, even after we had went to bed.

My wife booked this hotel through booking.com and she said they had great reviews unfortunately we didn't look at yelp cause we now realize how bad this place is.
When we first checked in everything seemed fine,  on our way out of the lobby the receptionist said there wasn't any internet or cable, this seems to be an ongoing issue over the past few months from what previous reviews have said.
As soon as we walked into our room,  there was an overwhelming smell of cigarette smoke but there's a no smoking policy. We put our luggage down, pulled out the hide-a-bed and all this popcorn and food came with it.
When we returned that evening, I went to take a shower and saw mold coming from the access panel in the shower. When I looked at the wall paper in the shower there was black mold all underneath it. I dried off and went directly to the lobby and said I wanted to cancel my reservation for the following day.
The lady up front was very polite and asked if we wanted to switch rooms but my wife and kids were already asleep so we decided to tough it out for the night. 
I was told the manager would be in at 6 am and that I could talk with him about the issues. I showed up at 6 am talked with Eddie and was given a receipt with a full refund. I will leave a better review if I do not have to fight to get my money back but from the reviews I've read,  it looks like I'm gonna have a headache coming my way. I hope not but we'll have to wait and see.

Cancelled the night after our cruise as we were very disappointed with our stay.  The only good we found with this hotel, and I use the term ""hotel"" loosely, was the agent that checked us in gave us a good tip for dinner at a ""local spot"".  There is no continental breakfast, you can find food to buy & there is an overpriced restaurant.  There is a charge of $15 per night to park your car, that is not mentioned in their advertising. There will also be a $200 hold put on your credit card for incidentals.  So we walk into our room, and come face to face with a big fist sized hole in one wall.  Stupidly, I assumed this would already have been noted by housekeeping, I mean, there was no way a person wouldn't see it!  Then I noticed popped popcorn sitting in the office chair.  I immediately turned to check the bedding, seemed to be clean.  The comfy armchair had big stains on it, there were nasty short black hairs on the shower wall, neither the sink or tub would drain, and the bottom of the tub had big chips in it.  We were exhausted, just ""let it go"" & that was a mistake.  If you have stayed at this hotel lately double check to make certain you got your $200 deposit back, because I didn't. I started calling several days ago, finally got someone in ""management"" to look into it last night.  I was informed the money was kept due to damages in the room, that there is a hole in the wall.  I was/am livid.  Housekeeping management has been consulted & no they could not confirm this was actually new damage....and the $200 is being refunded. (Haven't seen it yet, checking every day)
I can tell you they have problems that hurricane Ida did not cause, first is a housekeeping staff that isn't doing their job. Second, is questionable charges/fees on amenities.  Watch your charges & take photos of the condition of your room.  I wonder how many people they have done this to.",2021-11-11 22:02:24 UTC,1,0,0,0,CKkr8Px7QaPTP9CMccq5uw

While we did get a deluxe room (meaning it's renovated), the room is very small. The patio furniture was still very old and unfortunately, it faced the parking lot instead of the garden. That small detail makes a huge difference in privacy and random noises. I would suggest getting a room that faces inside rather than the parking lot. They do have a pool and lagoon area that is cool. We saw ducks and turtles.

The breakfast provided is still grab and go due to covid. 

As far as location, it's not centrally located in any of the cool spots visitors would go, but it is across the street from a Starbucks, In n Out, and IHOP. It's also next to the freeway and gas station. The Funk Zone and downtown are about 10-15 minutes away. The beach is about the same distance.

First of all, don't be fooled by the beautiful photography of the hotel -- the rooms are dark, many of the windows face brick buildings, the hardware is outdated, some of the rooms have toilets that don't work, there was mold in the showers...I can go on and on. 

The ""hotel gym"" is a bit of a joke, it's an 8x8 windowless room with 1 treadmill, 1 bike and 1 other piece of equipment.

The ""turn down"" service is unpredictable and questionable. The hotel had signs that notified us that ""Due to COVID-19, turn-down service was suspended."" This would have been fine, except our 3 rooms were serviced anyway -- poorly. One of the rooms was left half-cleaned, where the water glasses were restocked, however the beds were left unmade. Another room, had room service, during which the room was robbed.

Yes, robbed. Let's get to last part and the worst part of our stay. One of the rooms was swept clean of a laptop, two pairs of headphones and even the chargers for the electronics. This is bad enough, except the management tried to blame the theft on a ""bad lock"" on the front door of the room, insinuating that it ""could have been anyone"" and not the hotel staff. We can assure you that the lock was fully functional. And furthermore, if the lock on the room was an issue, why would you allow a guest to stay there in the first place? This seems wildly unsafe and negligent.

Read the reviews. They truly do a horrible job at cleaning. The first red flag I saw was there was a strand of hair on the toilet lid. After that things kept popping up. Next there were makeup stains on the bathroom door. 

Later I found some type of disgusting substance on the wall. It looked like someone spit into the wall with mucus all over it. Disgusting.

Oh and it gets worse. We have two Queen beds. We lay on one bed and realize there were blood stains on the covers. Yes, I said blood. I look at the second bed and guess what? More blood stains on the pillows.

kKfwRhExL-lwLFWF3aw3nQ,Omni Tucson National Resort,"Hotels & Travel, Restaurants, Beauty & Spas, Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Day Spas",Tucson,32.3581969,-111.023356,3,201,AZ,"I am so happy that I have finally stayed at this resort after years of intending to do so. Other than being on the premises a few times over the years, I knew of the Tucson National as the place my parents held their wedding reception back in 1988. I turned out to have a fantastic five night stay. There's a lot to unpack here, so I'm going to get started all while my suitcase will sit in the corner of my bedroom nearly untouched for the next week.

Let's start with the overall location and common areas. The homes right next to the resort, as well as all the grounds and buildings are a sight for sore eyes let me tell you; the property is an absolute beaut. It's one of the only local resorts that don't heavily play up the rustic, desert theme. As an AZ native, the rustic AZ stuff starts to feel cliche after awhile. There are a few cacti and native plants around , Mexican tile in the restrooms, and an awesome mountain view to remind you that you're in Tucson, but it's mostly palm trees, flowers and grass outside the Spanish-style buildings. I did not get to try the pool or spa services but it all looked very nice. The lobby was probably last remodeled in the early 90s like others have complained about ad nauseum, but the marble floors, dramatic staircase, plants, and very cool detailing made up for that. Plus, despite the age, nothing was rundown or in disrepair in that area. 

I really liked the staff, which is atypical as that is in area in which I usually find fault in these resort hotels. They were friendly as can be--even the guard gate operators. They are  responsive too--there was a fire department Christmas party one night, where several got drunk and thought it would be a good idea to strip into their underpants at 11 pm and dive into the pool in 43 degree weather. Security was on it promptly, and nipped that in the bud before it got out of hand.

Now on to the room--I was EXTREMELY impressed with the size and features for the price. It was right on the golf course, and offered a great view of that, as well as the Santa Catalina Mountans. The rooms have definitely been touched renovation-wise within the last decade, and everything was in great shape; I encountered none of the severe maintenance problems that others did, but those seem to be isolated to the casita rooms which indeed have not had any meaningful update since the 90s, and are not being rented out at this time. There is storage galore in these rooms: tons of drawers, and a very large (for a standard hotel room), walk-in closet. Most of the lights had dimmer switches, and the room has plenty of places to sit: a sofa, and two club chairs in addition to the desk chair, and beds. The television was just the right size for adequate viewing from anywhere. The bathroom was really nice too. The beds succeeded at being everything to everyone. The beds had just the right amount of firmness and softness with a nice, springy feel. 

As for COVID protocols, they had the usual room service menu that has to be accessed with a QR code, and they were a bit skimpy on bath products, towels, writing utensils, and coffee/tea; being the second time I've stayed in a hotel since COVID hit the fan, this has become the norm. We did ask for more, and they delivered. They had stickers on the hotel lobby entry door that they're AZ clean certified and not to enter if you feel ill, and tons of hand sanitizer, but mask usage throughout the property was next to non-existent. Because I believe opinions on COVID protocols tend to be politically-driven, I am declining to state my opinion, and instead will be giving you, the reader, the opportunity to construct your own opinion on the matter based on the info that I am providing.

As far as complaints, there are only a few. The first one is about television programming--it isn't fantastic. They have one HBO channel, but no pay-per-view in theater movies, ability to use streaming services, or ability to view the bill, TV listings, or in-room dining menu on the TV--most hotels of this caliber have something like this. The channels seem geared towards news and sports with some channels not having any audio at all. These rooms could also benefit from a mini bar or very small fridge--none of which were present, and that was surprising in an otherwise feature-filled room. 

I did not dine at Bob's this trip, or have room service but did dine at Legends, and thfood8i was very good. Refer to that restaurant's page for my review.

To say that I was bummed to have to go back home is a gross understatement. I could definitely see myself in the future, and I do recommend it to anyone who appreciates a very nice setting.",2021-12-21 22:49:21 UTC,4,0,0,0,T-3f-ABSq2wzFH1UEZFGDw

I wish I would've taken pictures of the lobby. I see there are plenty in other yelp reviews though. The hotel is conveniently located right near 2nd Street in Old City. There are plenty of bars and restaurants within walking distance. Many of the historical attractions are also within a few blocks. 

The rooms are very nice bright and comfortable. It seems as if the hotel was renovated recently. The showers are quite large and have double shower heads.  We had a king bed which was very comfortable. 

I think the hours of the bar and coffee shop are limited due to covid, but that's understandable.

Caution to those with allergies... The pillows are down feather. I had a bad experience once in another hotel so I proactively check before I go to sleep. I called down to the front desk and asked for different pillows. Housekeeping was not available but the security on staff quickly delivered new pillows to me. All of the staff were very friendly and accommodating.

The only downside to this hotel is the price of parking. It cost us $50 to park our car overnight.  This is a bit steep in my opinion. There are a few parking garages nearby that you could probably grab for about $25.

It is a Marriott hotel so it is not one of the least expensive you can get, but it is definitely worth it for the convenient location and nice rooms.",2021-04-15 02:42:42 UTC,4,1,0,3,3AH2mmRSnFofnMl89mTnSg

I've stayed at Four Points with better service. Let's get right down to why I will **never** stay at this property again:

Housekeeping 

Towels are apparently stitched with gold because rooms simply aren't serviced on the weekends. That's right, you heard it the front desk said to me ""housekeeping really doesn't work on weekends, especially when we're sold out."" 

Wait, what?

Front Desk: ""Unless you ask for housekeeping when they're here early, early in the morning you won't get service. Or you have to request daily housekeeping when you check in.""

Oh

Well why am I paying market room rates when I'm simply not getting the same service. I see Marriott is using COVID as an excuse to provide less services but charge the same or higher prices.  Got it. This has seriously made me reconsider booking at a Marriott property in the future and I'll consider that when comparing the points I get as a 7-year silver elite with Air BnB or another chain that actually cleans rooms and gives towels without special requests.

The plus with this hotel, is that some places are within walking distance, like Target, Starbucks, CVS, etc. 

Hubby stated this hotel was supposed to be a 4-star hotel. I will 4-star for the lobby alone, but overall 3 to put it mildly. The lobby is decorated beautifully, until you get to your room. 

This was out first overnight trip anywhere since COVID, and came prepared with my own cleaning supplies plus gloves. We checked in sometime after 3pm. The front desk clerk asked us about parking, and hubby advised that we pre-paid and parked in the garage which is located within the hotel, but apparently the parking garage and the hotel are not on one accord, since the clerk was unaware of that the parking garage has a multi address, but we appreciated her checking and confirming the mix-up. 

We were given our keys to Room 1035. 
Upon entry, I checked every inch of the room and got out the cleaning supplies before putting out bags into the room. I am so glad I did clean, because this room needed it. The window sill was stained with appears to be coffee, and I am not sure if our room was a smoking or non-smoking room, reaked of smoke and you can see the cigarette burns on the curtains. And really, when was the last time these curtains were washed?? They were badly stained and filthy. The room was somewhat cleaned but from the amount of hair and debree found, there is no way this room was thoroughly cleaned especially in the wake of a pandemic.  

I wiped down the walls as well, since I found drink stains all around the hotel room. The outlets were deemed unsafe, loose or missing all together. The mini fridge, and the complementary water/coffee area, was not deemed clean at all. Found disgusting particles of crumbs in the area of the dish for the cream/sugar. Dust all over the lids (which I prefer sealed in plastic) and were thrown out. In the mini fridge, found stains on the door, shelves, and leftover items in it, like a old receipt, and I was not going to try to guess the date on it. The ceiling was cracked and pieces of ceiling was coming down. 

The bathroom... more hair found on the door, counter area, and around the tub and toilet.  Thank God most of my cleaning supplies were from the dollar store. I thoroughly cleaned each area and sprayed everything down. The tub had chipping paint in a couple of spots, and the drain was hardly connected.

The hotel does offer you a iron and ironing board, which needed a new cover (which is not expensive to replace). Thank I brought my steamer. There is a gym on the 4th floor available 24/7. They provided headphones, hand sanitizer, and towels. The gym was nice, but one of the air conditioners was leaking and it left a huge puddle of water, making it unsafe for users. I liked they had a restroom in the facility. Also they had a office facility available for guests,  and they are several restaurants within the hotel,  be prepared to spend $$$. However there are some great places to get to on foot, Uber/Lyft, or public transportation.  

Overall, I like the location of the hotel, but if your lobby looks like a 5-star, so should your rooms. 

Before checkout, which is 11, we were still in our room at 10 am, when housekeeping started knocking, we were finishing up last minute packing and changing our clothes. The price point was reasonable.

My wife and son picked this for the location and rooftop pool. We were staying 3 nights and it stormed the first 2 which was upsetting but such is life, the outdoor pool was of course closed. We finally had a nice night to enjoy the pool and when we showed up it was like a scene out of House Party II.  There must have been 40-50 people using the area, they had food, a 12"" self powered PA system playing so loud that the speaker crackled, one man had a hookah, others were smoking cigarettes as well as weed and these party goers had their children with them as well.  Maybe they were guests or maybe someone let them in, either way it made the pool suck. 

The room was ""ok"" but felt dirty and worn. On our last day while packing up my son noticed, In the bathroom behind the towels what appeared to be, dried blood on the wall!  Looking up at the wall to the left there seemed to be a poor job of cleaning up something else on the wall (pics).  Did someone use this room to commit suicide? It grossed me out.

The tiny fridge had dents all over it (pic) and didn't have a very fresh smell.

Paid $2.50 for 6oz of a Kourig with no creamer and only generic sweet n low (in room was only decaf) Maybe I am used to staying at real hotels and not ones that just rely on their location to get guests.

Luggage rack was broken, one of the lamps looked broken, phone did not work properly, the shower wouldn't work unless the faucet was running making it feel like the shower was backed up, the toilet would sometimes run 15-20 min after you'd flush, the make up mirror was almost falling off of the bracket, the air conditioner would only run for short periods of time then shut off regardless of the settings, and the iron ruined one of my shirts. In terms of cleanliness, many surfaces felt sticky or you could see drink rings on many surfaces, there were stains throughout the floor and surface area of the room and bathroom, there was something spilled/splattered over the bathroom door, the sink and toilet were dirty, the ledge on the bathroom looked filthy and we found trash in one of the drawers. We originally were given two adult towels and ONE hand towel. We called the front desk within 30 min of check in and the response was ""talk to the manager when you check out"".

There had been times that I got stuck in a city and had to cancel the flight because I was being responsible to the people I fly with. Airlines, such as American and Southwest refunds the tickets, no questions asked on the same day, and the customer services asked me if I'm ok.

This time, I was going to fly to Vegas for work again (first time and hopefully the not again with UNITED). And unfortunately, I had to cancel the trip. United refuse to refund; and ok I can take that, but the worst thing comes, and it was the customer services, their attitudes were so bad that is so hard to swallow. I'm being nice and truthful when I'm writing the following:

The first guy said no without me finishing my words, and then began to repeat a ""transcript"" they had over and over again, regardless what I say. I tried to keep my calm and finally I had to hang up and call again.

The second lady was unapologetically stopping my words regardless what I say over and over again, PS: the exact same ""transcript"". After I explained my situation, I had to hang up again.

And both of them told me to file a refund request online on their website, but the exact word from the guy is ""and they will decline the request"". I was stunned and asked him why do I file for the refund online, and he said ""I don't know."" (the smirk I can hear from his voice. minds that I was being respectful the whole time.)

The experience was really bad. Now, they don't help us out, we don't help them. So no more business for this airline from me (if my life is not dependent on it). 

Be mindful when you purchase tickets from united, in my experiences, there are better services from other airlines.",2021-03-06 22:43:29 UTC,1,0,0,0,mjmsBQ7lLGnUX2zfTRv_jw

As someone with years of experience at Saddlebrook, I'm telling you to not go unless you'll only be there for the tennis or golf.

The photos on the website and spa brochures have seemingly not been changed once in my eighteen years of yearly vacations to Saddlebrook. The spa menus and the food menus have also seemingly not changed. Everything is priced at resort prices when it is definitely not worth that.

The resort is more or less deserted unless it's Christmas. It seems like every year there's less and less people. Desire that, I've dined at Dempsey's and been the only group there and yet still had to wait. Often the restaurants will be closed. The gift shop and ladies's clothing shop in the lobby also often seem to be closed more often than they're open. 

In my experience, I haven't had many problems with staff. However, many of them are kids.

In terms of noise, there are real issues. Our condo is right by the main pool. Seemingly every day, the DJ blares music from the pool, which can be irritating. At night, there are sometimes very rowdy and loud kids in the hot tub. When we've called about it, nothing was done. The walk from the main lobby to the hot tub is like two minutes. I mean, would it be that much of a hassle to walk down to the hot tub and ask the kids to take the party elsewhere? As others have mentioned, you can hear basically everything in your neighbor's rooms and the footsteps and flushing upstairs.

There's always at least one cockroach in the room. I've never thought to call and ask for a drink voucher, but I'll be sure to do that the next time I'm dragged down there.

They've been using the renovations excuse for years. In 2017, they said the renovations would be 70% done by the end of the year. Sure, there might have been renovations, but I can hardly tell a difference. So, congratulations on doing extensive renovations with little improvement? Why do you feel the need to mention the renovations in almost every reply when there's so many problems besides that?

There is a real potential to see professional tennis players there. When I was younger, my brothers got to see James Blake there. I think my parents also happened to coincidentally get to play golf with him when their golf group just happened to include him. 

One of the big plus sides for me has always been the alligators. They're on the golf courses and outside the ponds. When I was little, there were chocolate alligators in the gift shop. Bring them back!",2021-05-21 23:52:24 UTC,1,0,0,2,X2BN3BBtfikDpVxrsNTM5g

Pros:
--Walking distance to the marina and several nice restaurants along the ocean.
-- Short drive to State Street.
--A very clean and spacious room.
--Many TV channels.
--A free bottle of very good sparkling wine
--Daily happy hour (free wine), cookies and chocolate. 
--A small but nice hot tub.
-- Housecleaning was very good.
-- convenient underground parking.

Cons (for room #20)
-- I had constant difficulty getting my key card to work. I had to have new key cards made a half dozen times in four days. Several times I had to have someone come open the door to my room. Even more irritating than this was the response by front-desk staff: Most of them said, ""I'm not having trouble opening the door."" I said, ""It doesn't matter if you're not having trouble opening the door. What matters is that I can't get into my own room.""
--In general, staff were either indifferent or somewhat rude. 
--My back was killing me every night in this bed. The bed is either getting old or is slightly too soft.
--Walls are very thin, so you hear doors banging when people go in and out in the morning.

First, don't stay ON BOURBON STREET and bitch about noise. Bourbon Street IS noise - if that's a problem, stay someplace else. I hear Metairie is nice. 

Now, on to the particulars. It's an old building so expect smaller than average rooms with the dreaded interconnecting doors that amplify sounds. The bathrooms are TINY. It helps if you pretend you're in France (instead of the French Quarter) and you'll be much happier with the room size. Everything was very clean in our room but they are not doing daily housekeeping right now. We were on the top (5th floor) so street noise wasn't too bad but we did have leaky windows/some water damage. 

Staff was very nice & accommodating, especially considering the crowd they're dealing with. After dark, you need to show a room card so random weirdos can't just wander in. No restaurant/bar right now but in normal times they have both. There's a small (unheated) pool in the pretty courtyard plus some nice patio seating for hanging out.

Location is great - you're smack in the middle of the Quarter, with hundreds of restaurants, shops and bars within a few blocks. It's maybe a 20-25 minute walk to the WW2 museum and 5-6 minutes to Canal to get a streetcar. If you're determined to ""do"" Bourbon, Tropical Isle is across the street so you can definitely get shitfaced and crawl back to your room easily. If you prefer not to walk in puke, head over to Royal St, just a block away for nicer shopping and eating.

I rented a Corolla and had to return it shortly after getting on 70 due to the searing wheel shaking so bad it was hard to control the car at 45 mph. The next car had the same same shaky steering wheel but not as bad so I was confused if it was just the way the car drove. 16 miles from Thrifty at 75 mph there was a huge bang from the tire tread coming off so hard it blew the fender apart and I swerved from the middle lane into the first. Luckily there were no cars and we got to the shoulder unharmed. When calling back to Thrifty they said I did not choose insurance so it was my problem. After several calls and over 3 hours later, Thrifty did finally get a tow and a replacement car this time a KIA. The tow truck driver looked at the tire and the fender and said that someone maybe taking the tires off and replacing them with old tires as my tire was retreaded and is not normally a rental cars policy. The KIA had less than a 1/2 tank of gas and the two front tires were 23 and 25 pounds of air when they should have been 40 (lost $4 trying to fill air in tires from a gas station machine and ended up paying $15 at a truck stop to fill air). However, it was a very nice car and we were able to use without incident for the rest of our trip. I called the manager Jeff several times and had two messages left previously with his staff and received no return call. There is a serious problem with Thrifty's care of their cars and almost caused a serious accident from the blow out as well as the fender and tire pieces flying into someone else's car. Lives could have been lost. This is a very serious matter.
Thrifty doesn't care. That's even more serious. That means even more lives are at risk. If that wasn't enough, while we were on the Thrifty bus back to the airport the buses check engine light went off and when the driver called it in they told him not to worry about it and keep driving. All I can say is that I could not wait to get as far away from Thrifty and its vehicles and back on land as fast as I could. To date, I still have not received a call back from Jeff.",2021-08-03 20:49:48 UTC,1,0,0,0,5CBOOFEGHP3aAPte7mVYZw

I cannot even begin to explain the derogatory nature that we were addressed with!! We checked in after traveling all day from Southern California. We got our room and then went to dinner. After returning to our room and heading into the bathroom to take a shower I was affronted with a stench of sewage!! I knew we had not used the bathroom and wondered why would the bathroom smell this foul?! We asked for a new room. We waited 30+ minutes and were then directed to our new room...only to discover it was one floor down right below the SAME EXCACT room!!! How will this be any different?! We called the front desk again and said, you just moved us one floor directly below the same room, how will this be any different? Isn't it in the same sewer line? The front desk person, Marjorie, said I don't know. She said what do you want me to do?! She said I told you which room number it was, you should have known. ???!! Really,! I'm sorry, I was not provided a map of your property when we checked in. How would I be expected to know your property layout. I'm expecting you to know what our issue is and do your best to resolve it. We then were passed to Tristan who was equally condescending. We asked if there was a manager on duty. He said the manager will not be on property all weekend. He then said, at 11:30pm after we've been traveling all day, that we can walk the property with him to find a room we like. I'm sorry, I'm not walking your property after a full day of travel to find a room that doesn't smell like sewage with you. You should know which room to move us to to best solve the issue. I'm pretty sure that we're not the first people to report this issue on this side of the property. It's a sewer issue that needs to be dealt with. It shouldn't be pushed off on us and make us feel like it's our fault for being upset that it's almost midnight after a full dat of travel and we want to be able to peacefully relax in a nice, clean smelling room! The thing with the sewer happens. The issue we had the issue with is how the two front desk attendants handled it!! Not ok at all!! I will do whatever I can to direct people away from this property.

Staff is really nice and accommodating. You can check up to 2 bags for free. Plane is nice and smooth riding. The price was good. 

The Negative:
The seats are small. They have no assigned seats. They call group A. Group B and Group C. 
They call the Pre-boarding group first and slow boarders. Then Group A numbers 1-30 and families with children. Then Group A 31-60. This happens for b and C. I was always in the second group of B. So I found 2 seats together for me and my daughter but always towards the back. They start to announce there are no more seats together in the back, so if you see an open seat It should be taken. 
If you are traveling with a family you should pay the extra to go on early if you want to sit together. I don't like the idea of not having an assigned seat. Another thing is they changed my flight and only sent an email. It totally messed up my plans at the layover.

I recommend these rooms as they are large and are organized in a 6-plex building with outdoor patios or balconies making them feel more private than the posada rooms. The rooms have been remodeled recently with large stone showers, leatherette chairs and couches, very plush memory foam/pillow top mattresses, and the rooms retain the wood beamed ceilings. On this stay we booked a view room which overlooked the city of Tucson. Since we checked in after dark, it was nice to see the city lights from our patio. The bed felt almost too soft at first, as if there was 6 inches of pillow top/memory foam, but it actually slept very well and the pillows were a down/feather mix and very comfortable. However, It is not the best bed for propping  yourself up the read as you sink in too much making it hard to find a comfortable position.

The resort has a great workout room with views of Pusch Ridge, a large lap pool and numerous tennis courts. I have used the first two amenities several times. The grounds include a short walking trail and nice desert plantings and even several grapefruit trees which were ripe enough to pick in late December if you can reach them.

I have not tried the restaurant recently, but we used to go for Sunday brunch and the great view of the city.

One nit pick on this trip is that room service trays from the neighboring room sat around for two days before being picked up. A bigger issue and reason for only 4 stars is that our patio door glass was badly fogged and needed to be replaced. As you pay a bit more for a view room, the view should be clearly visible from inside your room, not just from the patio. The fogged glass obscured the view significantly.",2021-12-29 23:18:43 UTC,4,0,0,1,g48vic2Q7xae-NcfvtqC6w

It was just very comfortable.  The common areas are well-kept.  We were only there for 2 nights but got a very good impression of the property.  It had lots of amenities, and a location convenient to all kinds of restaurants and shopping.  The other guests seemed to be relaxed and having a great time...both couples and families. (As one reviewer noted, there were a few instances when we smelled pot coming in through the ventilation; this would be a pro for some, a con for others.  LOL)   The atmosphere was cheerful, with people using the bar, ""food truck"", the beach, sand volleyball court, pool.  Good music playing at the bar during the day, but not too loud.  And then it was quiet and peaceful in the evening.  HUGE beautiful beachfront!   Would definitely go there again.  Only recommendation would be putting some paper towels in the suites.  :)",2021-01-26 23:55:16 UTC,5,0,0,0,X8-1qTwBLRa-6zOTz5RpqQ

We have been coming here for years, and despite the COVID-19 Pandemic putting a damper on traveling in general, staying here is still great - even though the free breakfast is gone, and the fresh-made cookies in the afternoon are also gone temporarily. They have brought back the free wine in the evenings, but the cheese & meat platters are still MIA, due to COVID restrictions. The rooms are always clean, and most have been newly renovated. We recently stayed in a 1bed room suite, and loved it. The full kitchen was clearly brand-new; we saw other kitchens in a few other suites (due to open windows), and they were not as updated. A few other positives: walking distance to the beach; free bicycle rentals; free DirecTV with hundreds of channels, and a pool & spa. Most hotels in Santa Barbara do not have spa's. The prices range from $100-$250 per night, which is not bad at all for Santa Barbara.

Went here with a conference group, so we also had catered meals.  The meals were all very good, with one notable exception. One day they served a platter of grilled vegetables. They'd served these before, and they were a popular item with our group. On this day, however, someone forgot to actually warm them. The platter was cold, as in refrigerator cold.  They actually didn't taste that bad, but since we'd had them before we knew they would be better if warmed.  We didn't raise a fuss because we had business to attend to and, frankly, we were all hungry enough to eat it anyway.

The staff was very friendly, and helped out with most any request they could.  

The pool area, largely unused, is a great place to relax in the evenings. That said, the furniture out there (and, by the way, in the courtyard) is in dire need of replacement.  Cushions are fraying and stained.  Yes, it's by a pool, and it will get wet, but it shouldn't be dirty.

We booked a King Suite with separate living room at this hotel over a month before we arrived. I did this thru Marriot Bonvoy which is their loyalty program. I also called the hotel directly to confirm our room type. It was all set and I have the email confirmation of our room type. 
               When we got to the hotel. Nobody was there to check us in. We had to ask for a front desk person. Finally a young woman comes out from the back saying she was "" Looking for Earplugs"" That's never a good sign, so I asked since we have a suite will our room be  quiet, she said ""Oh yea, you're good"". Fine I thought. That is TILL we got to our room. It was Tiny and was directly over the swimming pool something I never request on my Bonvoy profile. I immediately tried to call the front desk and no answer. We decided to pack our bags and just got downstairs because clearly, a BIG mistake was made. This was NOT what I reserved. We get to the same young woman at the front desk and she proceeds to look at her computer and then tells us that we were ""Bumped by an Admiral customer""??? what?? I told her that I too was a long time client, back when it was called Starwood and that I too stay at these hotels many times. She was very snotty and replied that well, this person has more stays blah blah blah.  I told her in all my years of traveling all over, I had never heard of such a policy. I told her I would be calling Marriott's headquarters directly and basically he said "" Fine go ahead"" Like as if she couldn't care less!! 
         Being that  I was not going to just put up and shut up.  I then had to waste over two hours trying to find another hotel, This was not easy since the Rock and Mineral show was in town and the city was booking up fast. I was livid because if these people had told us BEFORE we got to the hotel that they had messed up, I could have at least had a better chance to find other accommodations faster! I also want to ad that we were never told how much our rate was. Especially since they downgraded us! 
          I was not going to put up with the snotty behavior and bad service of this woman. I did ask for a manager and they told me he's OFF and I could leave him a VM!  Lovely no manager?? !!! After I found us another hotel, we called the front desk to inform them that we would NOT be staying and this time another woman picked up. She explained she had just come on duty. I told her what happened and she admitted she had never heard of this Ludacris policy but the hotel was full and no suites were available. 
          After finally talking to Marriot Bonvoy a day or so ago, we confirmed what we suspected. That somebody at this hotel screwed up and gave away my room! Then tried to come up with some stupid excuse to cover up their mistake! 
          Be warned!! These people are dishonest. When I first called this property I asked how noisy was it since it was downtown, the girl on the other end of the phone ( Not sure if it was the same one who checked us in), but she said oh in a king suite its pretty quiet.

Long brown hair was in the tub, on the air conditioner vent and sand was in the bed. They said they couldn't do anything until the next day because housekeeping has already left. Well next day we go out and come back to...you guessed it a room still not cleaned. Called AGAIN and spoke to the manager who once again told me there was no housekeeping, they refunded one night!! Even though we have been in a dirty room for two days. 
Next, the door doesn't lock, lights don't work over bed, the door has a large hole in it where anything can crawl in, and the ELEVATOR DOES NOT WORK so we had to climb 4 floors to get to our room the entire time. Oh and the wood in the bathroom is rotting through. 

DO NOT STAY HERE!!! No matter what the others say . People are rude and unaccomadating due to them being completely booked. Worst motel ever!!

Update: while writing this manager came up and cleaned tub and ac. I have to give her props for doing that.",2021-03-22 21:36:00 UTC,1,0,1,1,4aItQiMwAsb69qqLhiC-Bg

I really like that they have done some updates to the facility to make it mobile friendly for check in and check out. I don't interact much with the staff now but the drivers are always friendly and the people checking out were always friendly as well. Prior to covered you received a bottle of water I truly don't know if they do that anymore cuz I always do express check out because it's so convenient. 

Two requests would be 1) for the mobile app to ask for a ride and acknowledge when the ride request was done. I've always wondered how they know who calls and if their is already a shuttle on the way or if I should call. I'm sure it's not an easy thing to change on the app but it would be pretty sweet. And 2) probably more security cameras on the parking garages so if someone hits your car you can look at videos. Just saying...

The suite was perfect for the 4 of us. It had a kitchen which was a very nice touch. The thing we loved the most was the full size fridge/freezer with a ice marker. The housekeeping upon arrival had loaded the dish washer with all the dishes and placed a sticky note that states ""the dishes has been cleaned & sanitize for your arrival"". Which was neat especially during covid. During our stay the house keeping did an incredible job of cleaning our room each day which is rare nowadays especially with covid-19. We loved how the couch was also a sofa bed which was nice to sleep our 4th person out on the couch. The only 1 compliant we had was everyday @ 5pm when in the bathroom you could smell of marijuana which eventually spread to our entire suite. We complained after 2 days and according to the front desk they kicked someone out the night before on the 2nd floor due to marijuana. The front desk agent stated she will look into the marijuana on the 3rd floor.   We loved this hotel so much we ended up booking a 1 night stay again for April 3rd after we return from Napa county.


When we checked in on April 3rd we were out into room 106 same room type as before. This room was a little outdated and showed age but was roomy for the last night before heading to the airport the next day. I highly recommend staying here.",2021-04-05 13:53:16 UTC,5,0,0,0,TEK0IRjOnKjnF3v3lZn7UA

She continued ""will you both be dressing as brides?"" We shared another glance, and responded that yes we were both going to be wearing gowns.. 

We discussed catering and other details, when we came upon a flyer for the preferred DJ. We inquired about using our own band or DJ to which she replied ""we have an African American DJ. He'll play the type of music y'all listen to. The music for you people. His name is Chris. He's great""

Fantastic location, short walk to everything. We recently spent a few days, three nights here. The front desk staff is miserable - I run a small business, I get that it's hard to be friendly all the time, but that's literally your job for eight hours. Don't make guests feel like a burden when they ask for toilet paper or towels for their rooms that housekeeping failed to provide. 

Bar staff is rude. No cold beer. Very slow service. Same with front desk staff. 

The rooms are dirty. Filthy. Gross. We had a corner suite with water views. Toothpaste marks on the mirror, dust everywhere, you could see piles of dirt and junk between the bed and bedside table, hair in the shower, etc. Very dim lighting in the room and in the bathroom especially (you will not be applying cosmetics in the bathroom), two small stained towels for two adults, no back up toilet paper, no liner in the garbage bin (that is inconveniently located outside the bathroom, instead of one in each room). Very small, poorly cleaned, unimpressive room. Stained towels, stained bedding, stained carpets. This place was a dump.

No WiFi. No cable. Some of the outlets don't work in the room. 

Extremely thin walls - we could hear the conversations of the couple in the room beside us, clearly, could have easily joined in. People in the halls carrying on all night. You're not going to get much rest here. 

My absolute FAVORITE part of this dump was the elevators. Oh the lovely, safe, updated elevators!!! At no time were all four working - this is a 23 floor hotel with only four elevators, and for much of our stay, only two were working, at times only one. I LOVED waiting in the lobby for more than thirty minutes to go up to my room on the 22nd floor. So much fun. And there's no bathrooms down there in the lobby - you can take stairs to the second floor bathrooms if you need them, but they're usually locked according to staff, and they were when I tried to access them after coming back to a line of almost two dozen people waiting for an elevator after we'd been out to dinner. Super convenient. Once, a group of us were stuck in the elevator and despite pressing the call button, no one picked up and no one came to assist. Two of the guys in the elevator eventually got the door pried open and we were able to exit. Super fun. When we told a guy who identified himself as maintenance he just shrugged and said he hadn't heard any complaints, the desk just said it happens and walked away back on their phones. 

I am extremely unhappy with the hotel, the cavalier attitude of the staff when we complained, the numerous safety issues, etc. I would NEVER recommend it and I would never go back. None in my group would. Absolutely a shame, wonderful location and you can tell that it was once a really nice place. This place was an absolute dump. We were a business group of more than two dozen, rented meeting rooms and all - we were all very unhappy with our accommodations and treatment. Our next trips to Nola, both business and professional, will be with another hotel and not this dump.",2021-12-06 15:51:49 UTC,1,0,0,0,btW7S_UIpyu2t2z7R4WyYg

We ended up here because my daughter and I were competing in the St Louis Ballroom Championships and the event was being held in the hotel.

When we pulled up the hotel is insanely huge and it was lit up (we got in late Friday night). As we walked in the place was busy and lots of people were walking around in the gorgeous ball gowns and such. We checked in easily and carried our stuff up to the room.

Here is where the hotel started to lose sparkle; when we got off the room the hall way smelled a little bit like smoke. Well we weren't sure if it was non smoking hotel or not but we hoped we weren't on a smoking floor and proceeded to our room. When we got in the room smelled a little old, and Smokey. It seems like they came in and refreshed the room but with not being able to open the windows there was no way to air the room out.

We stayed in a double Queen suite and the space was amazing! We had an entire separate room with a couch AND another half bathroom! That was an very nice surprise and bonus! The rooms were ""clean"" but with everything being so old it didn't feel clean. The carpet looked dusty/dirty and had some stains in it. The walls of the bathroom (which were some awkward wall paper) had stains in there as well. There also was not enough lighting in the rooms. Even with all the lights on it was still fairly dim for trying to put on makeup for a show. 

Overall the hotel is decent. You will enjoy yourself here but in the back of you head you will be looking around wishing they would upgrade. If I was in St Louis again this would not be my first choice.",2021-03-15 12:25:47 UTC,3,0,0,0,p_IZny24ir_XIA_hnCrNug

It got off to a rocky start, but the airport is currently hoppin' and I finally got to experience it for myself as a passenger on Allegiant's new BLV to CHS (Charleston) route.

There's no other airport quite like BLV, that's for sure. It's tiny. Technically, it has 4 gates, but it seemed like Allegiant was only using 2 gates. You won't be flying to NYC from here. Most of the flights are to Sun Belt destinations. The airport is surrounded by farms on one side and an air force base on the other side. You get to see and hear fighter jets while you're taxiing out to the runway. The parking is extremely easy and affordable ($8/day? that's nothing).

But believe me when I tell you that the greater Metroeast area has already outgrown this airport. The security and gate areas (everything on the upper level) felt very cramped. The TSA line wasn't long per se, but it started backing up quickly, creating a bottle neck on the stairs. That setup just isn't going to work longterm. Other observations: The airport doesn't have a single restaurant (It has a concession stand.) There's no water bottle filling station. The bathrooms need ADA compliant sinks.

But rather than feel dated, this place manages to be fresh, modern, AND glamorously authentic and ""historic""- I think Walt Disney himself is outdone in how they manage to balance all of these aspects for an outstanding Guest experience.

I always find the materials that a hotel chooses to use speak volumes about how they respect and care for their patrons - and this boutique hotel is no exception. Fine white Italian marble and hand painted glazed Spanish tiles with expensive fixtures in all the bathrooms; fully stocked Nespresso machines for an outstanding cup of coffee or espresso first thing in the morning; fine linens atop plush mattresses and pillows, one of the most generous selection of channels I've enjoyed in a hotel for years - literally almost every worthwhile channel ... including some of the premium ones...

And the kicker: everything is immaculate - I can't remember the last time I stayed in a hotel that felt this fresh and clean and inviting... AND - I kid you not - one of the best AC thermostat systems I've ever enjoyed - the room literally was exactly the temperature that you put it at within moments. That's very rare indeed!

It's clear that the owners and management take tremendous pride in maintaining this legendary landmark. And making it feel livable and enjoyable and luxurious every moment that you're there.

Bonus perks: one of the most charming pools and jacuzzi spas i've ever had the pleasure of lounging at... An old school 1927 gated Otis lift elevator - where you literally get to see the floors as you go up and down - the kids in the hotel were having a blast riding it like it was a Disneyland ride!

And to boot: a gourmet restaurant literally attached to the West wing of the hotel!  Your room service literally comes from a gourmet restaurant!

The reason for four stars out of five is that the staff is for the most part very green, and several small mistakes were made in communication throughout this stay. Certainly nothing that ruined the overall enjoyment and experience - but definitely created some wasted moments and definitely added up over the three days. I realize that post Covid, it must be challenging to have seasoned staff, but the hotel is deserving of far better communication and overall service from the front desk and valet. Everyone was sweet and clearly enjoyed their jobs - but definitely wanting in the experience and sometimes thoughtful department.

A suggestion to ownership: if you know that you've got a major national holiday weekend coming up that's already oversold, perhaps have at least one manager around that weekend...? 
Certainly with the staff being mostly newer aka inexperienced (in some cases - immature) - it seemed curious indeed that not a single manager was on-site Friday through Sunday... ESPECIALLY with so many seniors and children in occupancy ... 

Of note: Ramone did an admirable job balancing front-desk duties with concierge requests - excellent.  And Paola (though not on-site for our stay) went above and beyond to ensure the stay was overall outstanding.

In fairness to future guests: this hotel was built in the 1920s. Overall people were of smaller stature, and the architecture reflects this in most of the rooms. The luxury suites on the first floor not withstanding - most of the rooms are quite small, reflecting the era during which they were built.

Two other unfortunate circumstance from this Historic stature - there's really no getting around this so might as well be honest and transparent: the Inn is in fact right next to the freeway. Obviously - it was built there when there was no freeway, but great pains of been taken to ensure that this does not hinder the overall Guest experience.

The other unfortunate circumstance from it being such an old building almost 100 years old: sound proofing was definitely not one of the requirements in the early California building codes. This is reflected in several reviews and unless the hotel chooses to do a major renovation adding soundproofing - you can expect in most rooms to hear conversations in the hallways, in adjacent rooms or above you.

These challenges aside, it was definitely one of the nicest stays I've had in the longest time - and beat out a lot of experiences at hotels far more expensive and ""luxury"" -

This Hotel is a must-stay for anyone craving an amazing Southern California get away.",2021-07-07 10:38:59 UTC,4,0,0,0,xHidl7V72Zq5ZmDBpeHmcw

I had low expectations for seeing whales, but we saw at least ten humpbacks and dozens of sea lions feeding when we visited Santa Barbara in mid April.  I can only say good things about our whale watching cruise. The crew was friendly and the captain was very knowledgeable about the marine life we encountered and provided a good description of their feeding behavior. He also positioned the boat so the lighting was optimal for pictures.

Highly recommend paying the extra $5 to get a seat on the top deck. There are less people on the top deck and they'll serve you drinks when you're seated while you get out far enough to see any marine life. 

Parking on the pier can be a bit of a mess. We parked in one of the neighborhoods across the street and walked about ten minutes. The ticket station is close to the end of the pier so give yourself ample time to make your tour, they recommend at least 30 minutes. You can book reservations online directly through their website or you can buy tickets the same day. You might have to wait for the next tour if you don't buy tickets in advance.

If you get sea sick, take some ginger candies or dramamine with you. We also brought ginger ale just in case. Take an actual camera if you have one. I don't know how anyone got any good shots with their phones. You don't get that close to the whales, remember they are protected marine mammals.

I couldn't ask for more for my first whale watching tour. This will definitely not be my last whale watching tour with Condor Express.",2021-06-29 03:26:50 UTC,5,0,0,2,gHpNqTAH2FpPCBO6p_YtYA

Upon entering the room there was a distinct smell of mold and mildew. The smell was so strong that I immediately started having headaches, blurred vision and stomach upset. I contacted the front desk and was told that they could not do anything until the manager returned the next morning. The next morning on 08/15/2021 I again contacted the front desk and this time I was told that their was not a manager on-site at the present time and to contact the manager the next day. I contacted the chains guest service department to lodge a complaint and to also inform them that I required a room change or to be transferred to one of their other hotels as the smell of the mold and mildew was only getting worse and making me very ill at this point. I was given a complaint number and told again that they could not transfer me into a different room until the following day which was today. I was also told that I could not be transferred to another facility in your chain without paying some absurd fees which I don't feel should be my responsibility for your companies failure to provide a safe healthy room at check in. I called once again to the front desk this morning at 9am and I spoke with a manager that advised me that they would have another room for me to transfer into after 11:30 am this morning. At 3:00 pm today I was called and told by the manager that another room was ready and that I could come by and get the keys at any time as I was already away from the hotel room because I couldn't no longer stay there being ill. The manager didn't advise me or ask me for a timeframe in which to do this. I get to the front lobby of the hotel and then was told that they in fact did not have a room ready for me they had given my room to someone else and that I would have to stay in the mold and mildew infested room yet another night and wait until tomorrow. This is very unacceptable as this is a risk to my health staying in that room one more minute. This establishment should be fined and/or shut down because they obviously have no care for customers health and well being especially since we are still in the COVID-19 pandemic. And yet they are not taking this matter seriously. Customers should not be expected to stay in a room that is an obvious health risk. Customers should however, expect to receive the room and cleanliness as advertised and pay for. Not only was the room riddled with the mold and mildew smell but the kitchen was not fully equipped as advertised, there was no coffee maker, the refrigerator also smelled bad and was dirty on the inside, there is obvious mold and stains all along the outside. The inside of the toilet has obvious mold and mildew inside, the towels provided were dirty and stained. There were no apologies by any of the staff for these inconveniences or any attempt to rectify this problem in a timely manner, that is before I would end up hospitalized for being forced to endure staying in a room breathing in moldy air.",2021-08-18 00:43:32 UTC,1,0,0,0,zp-JmXPefQ2jYmZ6seCuCQ

If you have any dietary needs or allergies, you are going to have a difficult time. My girlfriend's dad has a gluten allergy and my girlfriend called Carnival ahead of time to tell them this, but throughout the entire trip, the dining room was completely clueless about his allergy and kept offering him things with gluten in it anyway. A lady that sat next to us in the restaurant one night even said that they tried to serve mushrooms to her even though she has a severe mushroom allergy that she told them about. The dining room on board definitely is not equipped to handle guests with allergies.

My girlfriend also tried to call ahead to tell them that I'm vegan, but they said they didn't have an option to notate that and to just tell them when I get there so they can accommodate me. I did that only for my waiter to tell me they have 'very limited options' to accommodate me since they didn't know ahead of time. (Keep in mind that we DID try to tell them ahead of time.) They ended up feeding me a small dinner of vegetables and a potato that night that tasted fine but was not filling. After that happened, I told them they could make me pretty much anything they wanted the following night as long as it wasn't spicy....only for them to serve me a super spicy dish that I struggled to eat. The night after that, they at least served me something I could eat, but it was a super small portion and I left hungry. 

After that happened, my girlfriend and I went to guest relations because we were fed up. They ended up having us speak with the maitre d and the sous chef to sort everything out. They reassured us that they would provide me with a reasonable portion of food I could eat and that the dining room wouldn't give us a hard time any more. This unfortunately wasn't completely true, as the people in the dining room were still mostly clueless. At one point, a waiter even tried to tell me that I ordered the 'Indian vegetarian dish' even though I had absolutely no idea what that was, and they tried to offer me dairy ice cream with my dessert. I'm happy I was able to finally get reasonable portions of tasty food the final two nights and I really enjoyed the spinach and mushroom dish they made for me, but the whole experience was ridiculously inconvenient and I felt like a burden the entire time. This was really disheartening, as I had read from multiple people online that Carnival was very vegan friendly. That may have been true pre-covid, but I guess it's not anymore.

My (non-vegan) girlfriend and her parents have been on cruises prior to this one and they all agreed that the quality of the food onboard has gone downhill. Their portions were smaller than usual, most of the food wasn't as good as it used to be, and they now want you to pay for food options that used to be included. While there were some food options they enjoyed, they were overall underwhelmed in comparison to their previous experiences.

Also, the ship apparently has some maintenance issues, as the water that came out of our bathroom sink was so thick and yellow that it looked like urine. My girlfriend spoke with multiple people about this issue and was given a different excuse every time. We ended up using some of the drinks in our Cheers program to buy water bottles so we could brush our teeth. Even the R-rated comedian on the ship made fun of how disgusting the water is in her final set. This is honestly just really gross, and I'm appalled that Carnival is allowing people to ingest and bathe in contaminated water on their cruise ships. I've attached a photo to this review as proof. Would you knowingly drink that? Surely not.

I have mixed opinions on the evening entertainment offerings. The Divas show was really fun, and the Rock show was pretty cool, but there's one egregiously bad female singer in the performance group that made some segments really difficult to watch. I'm talking cringe-worthy bad. Carnival should do a better job vetting the quality of their performers.

It wasn't all bad, though. The employees on board are ridiculously kind. We made sure to tip our steward and the bartender at the Lido bar extremely well. We also had no difficulty getting alcohol when we wanted it, and had fun gambling in the casino. The photographers on board are also really talented and me and my girlfriend were able to get some great professional-quality photos. We ultimately managed to turn lemons into lemonade and have a good time, but it shouldn't have been such a struggle to do so. 

When I search for a cruise line to take my next cruise with, Carnival definitely will not be my top choice.",2021-11-29 21:23:13 UTC,2,1,1,2,qNT0R05DDgMaraUHALA43g

So our only complains and the reason for 4** in stead of 5** is limited amenities (pool hours not only limited but set very uncomfortably for the visitors right around dinner time 5pm to 10pm, It would be nice to move the starting time at least to 4pm), and cut off benefits for Diamond members at breakfast facilities.

This is when I discovered that the mattress was filth and I saw little bugs that appeared to be bed bugs. I ended up sitting up all night in a chair that was also filthy. Please don't stay here.

Some things were pretty great... the service, the ribeye, as well as the grits I got as a side were quite good! But, enough was off with the meal that I felt like I should write a review here. 

I was *really* excited by the first thing I saw on the menu: a starter soup of Maine lobster tomato bisque with truffle. It was $29, but I was treating myself, and figured that between the lobster and the truffle, it was special enough to splurge. 

I wish I hadn't. 

What came out was basically a bowl of tomato soup (where was the bisque element??) with an over cooked lobster tail in it. There was a singular ring of cooked onion in there for some reason, and the entire ensemble was seriously under seasoned. Not only was the truffle flavor nonexistent, but the soup itself was not salted. Like, at all. As in, I'm pretty sure whomever in the back was responsible for prepping this tomato broth completely forgot to put salt in it in the first place. For a $29 starter, I was massively underwhelmed. 

My entree (steak, grits, and ""charred"" broccolini) was good, but the charred broccolini wasn't charred at all... it was more sautéed. I had to stop eating my meal at one point to wait for someone on wait staff to come refill my drink... that was about 5 minutes of waiting. And then finally, the dessert selection was interesting, but there were no gluten free options available on the menu. The waiter offered that they did have sorbet and ice cream, so I settled on a scoop of the chocolate ice cream. What I was served was a small scoop, barely the size of the spoon I was given to eat it with. Given that their pastry chef ""really loves his allergens"" (the waiters words) and couldn't be bothered to put options on the menu that patrons with very typical food allergen issues could have, I was honestly surprised that they were so stingy with the size of the scoop of ice cream they served. 

I was told by someone who used to work for the Windsor Court Hotel that the food quality wasn't great, but I honestly didn't expect to be this disappointed. A restaurant of this quality should honestly be ashamed too, and I do hope they see this review and consider where they could have done better.",2021-11-08 17:49:10 UTC,2,0,0,0,Owh1MGqFYC1Z0bGU-QlqRg

I love the location of this hotel. It's about 6 blocks from the casino and 10 blocks from Bourbon street. No need for me to rent a car everything was in walking distance. It's not so close in town that there is a lot of traffic. 
When you first walk in you need your key to open the front door. I thought that was super strange but I understand it's for safety

Well I have come to learn that NOLA people just aren't southern friendly. There is no additional conversation no matter what. I am very outgoing love to talk and will keep a conversation going. Nope  not NOLA folks. At least the ones I have encountered especially the front counter staff. Just plain old check in, get key there you go.

The door to the room basically had to be slammed shut in order for it to close. The door was slightly off the hinges and would not close any other way. Later I heard many slamming of doors and realized that the door problem was not isolated to just my room. Let's move onto the AC unit on the window. It was held up by duct tape and a prayer. The bathroom was dingy and in disrepair. The wall outlets would not hold our phone charging plugs. The door did not have a safety latch to secure it when you were on the inside. You have to run around the shower in order to get wet. That is assuming that you can figure out how to get the shower turned on. The elevator looked like something from a horror movie. We did not go in it for fear of it malfunctioning. I am being generous by giving it one star. My advice? Go else where.,2021-02-16 20:47:35 UTC,1,0,0,0,8K1wPwtZCab3qAicoSuM2w

Each room is connected to another room (except the ones at the end of the hall) and you will be able to hear every single thing your neighbor does. For example, my neighbor likes to wake up at 5:45am and stays up late watching action films. But it's not even just alarms and the TV that you can hear, you can hear conversations, and even the sound of him flipping the pages in the newspaper. Personally, noise doesn't bother me and I can sleep with a lot of noise but that's how thin the walls are that it bothered my boyfriend and I. 

A side note -- we asked for an extra pillow and they claimed that they were out of pillows (which is weird that a hotel can run out of pillows) but eventually they did give us one.

We rented our car in Missouri with an unlimited mileage 
Clause. First of all we were given an unsafe car, it had 50,000 miles on it, and as it turned out had not been maintained! Maintenance light kept coming on, no water in washer reservoir and to top everything off in that category we had to buy a new tire to replace the defective tire that was on the car! To date we have not been reimbursed for that!!!

But the real issue was the unlimited mileage scam. We were never told at check out that to qualify for 
the unlimited mileage we had to stay in their boundary! We drove from Missouri to Texas and ended up having to pay a GPS  finders fee plus $20 a day extra for being out of bounds. UNBELIEVABLE! Had we been told this ahead of time we never would have used this rental company! 

We ended up turning the car in early and will NEVER rent from Thrifty Car Rental again. I suggest you don't either. If I could have written this review with no stars I would have! Oh by the way.

The pool would be nice if it wasn't so crowded that's not the hotel's fault though.
I paid for a king suite the water pressure in the shower was terrible! Not a huge deal I dealt with it then we get ready for bed and I pulled the blanket back to see a blue stain and a small brown stain on the bed. I let the water pressure slide but I was not going to let the stain slide. I called down to the front desk and they get us a different room. They're not knocking off any of the price because they say it's the same price. So we pack up after we had already taken our showers. Only to be let down again! Now we all have to sleep in separate beds. I got the king room so that my husband and I could sleep in a bed and my son could sleep on the couch part. The front desk said it was a double Queen but these beds are definitely not Queen! Maybe a full/double maybe! My husband and I are big people so we will not fit on one of these beds together so now I'm in one bed he's in the other and my son on the couch not ideal! Not what I paid for!

We schedule to pick up the van the day before we left for our trip, we got there at the time we set to pick the vehicle. We we're told the van was ready, when the service rep pulled the van up I did a quick vehicle inspection (under the hood fluids, tires, lights, interior, etc.) because we were traveling out of state so I wanted to make sure the vehicle was good to go. Some red flags caught my attention such as low coolant level, rear blinker light not working, and the interior wasn't cleaned out completely. I found small articles of trash, papers and a book from the previous renter. I did bring this all up the the service rep, and because they do not do maintenance onsite for the vehicles they had reached out to their location in Oro Vally I believe, to see if they could get another van. We did manage to get a more clean and newer van from the Oro Vally location, but it did take almost 2-3 hours to get it to the Wetmore location. I believe our original pick up time was around 12:00pm or 1:00pm but with all that happened we were not out of the place until after 4:00pm. It was kind a a bummer that they did not offer a discount or at least knock off some money for the inconvenience which was all on their part, but hey at least we got a van. It worked out for our long trip, I just suggest you actually take a look at the vehicles you are renting to make sure they're road safe and road ready by performing a basic inspection. 
Also a bit of a heads up, if you are renting a bigger vehicle like in our case a passenger van or high end vehicle (large SUV's or sports cars) they do require a credit card when renting.

First, but not foremost, the location is outstanding. Bienville House is on the edge of the French Quarter and across the street from public parking and the Mississippi River. If you want to park onsite, the valet will take care of you for a little more than the car park across the street. Foremost, however, was the care and hospitality we received, from the front desk, housekeeping, security, and the valet. Next, this is a historic boutique hotel. To that point, Bienville House is decorated in the French style, while at the same time is tasteful and clean. Unfortunately, the complimentary breakfast is on shutdown due to the pandemic. Nonetheless, complimentary coffee and tea is available each morning. For breakfast, turn left out the front door and walk two blocks over to the Ruby Slipper Cafe for sumptuous dine-in or take-out.

That being said the manager tanked this rating. We came up for my nieces birthday/graduation. I got there after my niece and her friend did and they had used window markers to decorate the our window in ""Happy Birthday"" / ""Congrats Grad"" cutesy designs. While I completely understand a hotel not allowing that and telling us to take it off, how he went about it was completely unacceptable. I even understand being frustrated when coming to tell us, but this was way more than that. 

We just got back from the pool and the girls (one a minor) we're changing in the main room area. The manager knocked two very quick knocks and immediately came in, while these girls were in the middle of changing. My niece had to run off into the bathroom almost naked and almost being seen by this older man. This is by far my biggest beef with the situation. If he had came a second or two later he would have walked in on a minor that was exposed. That's DISGUSTING, barging in on a room and giving no time to come answer the door to a hotel room. 

This man brought TWO staff members behind him as if a room of girls is a threat here? He was borderline yelling at us as I apologized immediately and multiple time. I tried (with him interrupting me and talking over me) to explain that: I got there after they had done that, we had everything to clean it up, all the intention to clean it spotless. I was overly polite and apologetic the whole time (also clearly shaking and visibly upset as he continued to berate us). 

He still threatened to kick us out and add a large cleaning fee. The same man who was so nice and welcoming during breakfast turned around and became unprofessional and disrespectful with the drop of the hat. The girls were having anxiety attacks and crying, like good lord. If I acted like that in any of my jobs I would be fired. Before becoming a teacher, I worked in customer service since I was 14. I maintained higher levels of professionalism than this man as a sales floor rep and cashier and would have been fired immediately if I had acted like this towards a customer. 

Anyways we left that damn window cleaner than it was when we got there and stripped & tipped the room for the cleaning crew. They were very sweet, went out of their way to check on us and help us, and helped us get necessities at every turn. They deserve 5 stars and a raise. We would have never left a mess for them to clean, as he implied we would.

Here goes: magnetic keys didn't work most of the time in the door
Noticeable hair on floor, puddle of water to the left of the bed, used bandaid and unknown packet of something inside door, no soap, no way to hang shower head, it was just suspended from the waist high connector and lying on the handicapped shower seat, lid to toilet had feces on it, multiple stains on bed spread, TV controls were full of stains and food, the room had obviously not been vacuumed as after taking our shoes off who knows what was stuck to the bottom of our feet.
We did not partake of the breakfast because of how the hotel looked, we weren't sure of the kitchen it came from.
We also enjoyed the shuttle driver whom we are praying for as he is battle leukemia.
Also Vonda the receptionist who checked us in was accommodating. I'm assuming she doesn't check the rooms to make sure they really HAVE been cleaned properly.

You could see the water marks on the tub bottom from what I assumed to be the last shower since you could even see the splash marks then the wall of my shower was covered in another woman's hair as well. We also had concerns with the room next to us which involved a possible neglect issue going on but even if it wasn't they were screaming and yelling from 11pm-2am and it was loud enough you could hear it down the hall at times. At first I called the front desk and asked for someone to come up and just check in on them maybe ask them to quiet down a little. No one came up though at midnight I went down to the front desk and just reiterated that I was concerned for the child in the room and they assured me they would send security up there and then determine if they needed to call the police sadly it sounded like they came up and didn't hear anything for the whole five minutes it calmed down and yet again nothing was done. Now it did end up calming down around two and yes I did look into other things I could do but there wasn't much without me having actually seen the child. But over all I didn't feel like the late night staff was as friendly or caring as the day staff and honestly the security guy was an older man walking around watching videos on his phone and joking around with the front desk guy instead of keeping an eye out for security related things...

While the given common denominators are we both want to be with each other and we both want the destination to have beautiful views & water... that looks different in my mind's eye versus hers. 

In my mind, I want to be in the mountains hiking waterfalls, scenic overlooks and peaks. But my wife prefers the sound of ocean water lapping against the shore, deep sunsets and miles of beaches. Well if you follow my reviews you undoubtedly have noticed I've done a lot of hiking to a lot of waterfalls during the first half of this year. Primarily because they are easy and inexpensive day trips or short weekend getaways, but also because hiking is better in cooler weather. However, now that the heat has arrived and summer is in full swing, I dare not lose my life telling my wife we are going to the mountains again. Besides, SHE booked this trip so I had little say on where we were going! LOL 

Our credit card often invites us on time share presentations that basically pay for the accommodations as long as we attend a 90-minute presentation. Many people pass on these offers, but they are GREAT ways to travel and save! Bilmar Beach Resort happened to be the accommodations that were offered and what great accommodations they were. Located on Treasure Island between St. Pete Beach & Madeira Beach, it was the perfect place to hunker down with the love of my life.

FIRST, let me say the BEACH here is extremely wide! Treasure Island has a boardwalk that makes walking along the beach super easy, but it also has about 900 feet of dry sand between the boardwalk and the Gulf waters. It's a HUGE beach, unlike the surrounding beaches that are narrower. My wife was in heaven each morning for quiet walks and each evening for sunset views (since it's west facing).

SECOND, there are lots of walkable options for food and fun! The South building houses Sloppy Joe's with its killer blackened grouper sandwich, respectable shrimp n' grits and yummy pancakes in the morning. They have great Gulf views and a full bar. But directly across the street is Ricky T's Bar and I tell you what, it was hoppin'! Truly sounded like everyone was having a fantastic time with the live music and excited crowd. Around the corner is Captain Bill's s Oyster Bar and the oysters are fantastic. How could they not be when they have a guy who call himself the Mother Shucker shucking all the fresh oysters.

THIRD, there are TWO pools and a second restaurant in the north building. I believe beach loungers also come with your stay and I also noticed free bikes available. Kayaks, surf/boogie boards and volleyball also offered.

BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, our tower room was cozy and comfortable. Outfitted with a huge flat screen tv, two queen bed, super comfortable mattresses & pillows, a small kitchen and barn door bathroom with backlit mirror and walk-in shower. The décor was bright and beachy, with splashes of color and conveniences such as fragrant hand/body washes + shampoo & conditioner dispensers. My wife wanted to take the body wash home because she loved the smell so much!

Please know this is not a prestigious sort of resort, but in my opinion, I think they are doing a great job with what they have despite the obvious age of the buildings.

FINAL THOUGHTS

My only complaint is the lack of parking when you spend the day out and come back late. While there are enough spaces for all guests, the proximity to the beach and restaurants cause some spaces to be filled illegally. But to their credit they do try to keep unwanted cars out with a Lot Monitor and also have overflow parking across from the south tower next to Walgreens. So for all the reasons I have listed above, I'm gonna go all out and give them 5 stars! I would definitely stay here again and really appreciated the front desk staffs friendly recommendations!

Parking is a nightmare. You have to use a parking garage and walk way too far to get to your room. It's especially bad when you can't park on the level you are assigned because there is no place to park. Up to the next level, only to have to walk down 2 flights of steps to get to the hotel skywalk. No fun when you have luggage. Once you make it inside the hotel, it's down a steep ramp, turn left and walk up another steep ramp until you make it to the elevator to your room. Just the dumbest damned setup I ever dealt with, real Mickey Mouse BS.  Before you leave at anytime and return, you have to go down to the lobby and have your garage ticket validated, otherwise you'll get charged. A real nuisance. A breakfast in their restaurant is included with your stay. Is it worth eating? Only if you're diabetic like myself and positively need to eat before the old glucose level takes a dive. The food is cold and bland, and the orange juice is God awful tasting. The pancakes were overcooked and chewed like a Goodyear tire. Hint: Go to IHOP. We had to switch rooms due to a badly leaking toilet, leaving the floor all wet. We were given another room right below the Grand ballroom. That worked out well, what with music blaring from a Saturday night wedding party until 11pm. The ballroom staff was banging around doing whatever they do until past midnight. Make sure you do not get a room on the 6th floor if you stay over the weekend. No one came in to clean the room while we were gone. No clean towels, had to go down to the lobby. How in hell this hotel gets the positive reviews it gets is beyond me. The chairs used in these rooms are ancient, and I'm guessing it dates back into the '70's. C'mon, put some cash into this place and make it right! It has the potential to be one sweet hotel, but not with all the problems it has.

I do believe that it captures a great time period for this area. The employees at the front desk and the valets were very nice. I was especially proud of the young man at the front desk who kept his composure when being scrutinized for wearing a face mask by a inebriated woman staying at the hotel. The complementary coffee was very good as was the location proximity to the wine valley. This is a great location for anyone looking to explore the whole greater Santa Barbara area (St. Inez wine valley, Los Olivos, downtown Santa Barbara,...) and your a short 20 minute walk from the beautiful Pacific shoreline. If you get a chance walk or bike along the beautiful flowered pathway that runs parallel to the beach, you won't regret it.   Also, there are some very good restaurants in the area including the one on the first level of the hotel. Breakfast from Jeannine's Bakery on the next block was also very, very good as were the baked goods.  The one thing I would not do if I were to return is pay extra for the mountain view because you can pretty much step out of any room and look across the street to see the mountains.

One of the nicest things I experienced was when we checked in and my husband mentioned it was my birthday. The manager gave us a bottle of wine from a local urban winery- very nice touch!

We're so glad we decided to stay here. 

TL;DR: this is great. Not likely to be 5 stars, perhaps, just because of age and amenities, but a good value as far as SB goes, especially if you have time to be outdoors here. 

The grounds are absolutely impeccable; incredible. I can't imagine not being absolutely shook by the beauty of these grounds. Like, I know you Cali kids get spoiled by beautiful surroundings, but there is still something jaw dropping about arriving at a random airport motel, getting past the front desk, and realizing this would be like the most beautiful place anywhere in the entire area code back at home. But here, it's just the pool and pond area of an unknown airport motel. 

The front desk staff was helpful and friendly. The shuttle service was fine... not perfectly on time but not so late as to make us stressed out, and once we got in the car this guy was an absolute pro. 

We didn't spend much time in the room. We checked in, and I did some re-packing and sorting to make our travel day easier while my husband returned our beloved little Jeep to the Turo gal. We were so sad to see it go! 

But when he got back, we took a quick and affordable Uber to State street for an early dinner, beach walk, and little jaunt along State Street. By the time we got back, our day had stretched from 7A-9P and our babies just passed out. Let me tell you, we could have slept anywhere at that point, but the beds were comfy and at least where we were, it was very quiet. We were awake and waiting for shuttles with the pilots and flight attendants, and it did, in fact, make for an easy morning. 

Coffee was strong, hot, good and most appreciated. Kudos to this team of hardworking folks and everyone here who is taking care of the landscaping.",2021-08-31 04:27:23 UTC,4,9,3,5,SLebVt7r1SO6LKkhzjZJFA

First off, we had booked through a third party app that did not allow us to select how many people were in our party so we are automatically given a basic king bedroom by the hotel. The hotel front desk associate said that was part of the deal/discount by using that app and that there were no rooms available. Only until my husband had to press further, Oh really? You have no rooms after the weekend of graduation is over, on a Sunday evening? that he switched his gears and, ""let me work some of my magic"" and believe it or not, a room magically became available...

My husband tipped him anyway (bless his generous heart) and the guy didn't even bother to tell us that the only way you can access the garage is through the 3rd floor exit door at the end of the hallway to the left. And that you can only go in the garage from the building, but you can't get back IN THE BUILDING because the door locks. You have to walk outside to the front entrance just to go back to your room... we thank the lady who works at resident side of Aerston for explaining to us that.

Not only that, but he failed to mention that you have to always come back to the front desk to check in with your parking ticket EVERY time you go out so that it gets billed to the room. 

Then when we went upstairs, the TV didn't work. We called the front desk and he said apparently there's a magical trick to this too. You have to press channel up twice or something. And then it worked lol.

We stayed there for 2 nights and it was comfortable. The showers were really nice and spacious and we loved their boutique soaps. On the third night we tried out Loews and didn't like it so we ended up back at the Aerston. This time, we got a guy who was EXCEPTIONAL. Great service, informed us of EVERYTHING, even went so far as you give us the tip that if you park on the 6th/7th floor of the structure (I forget, inquire with the desk) that you can get in and out of the building from there. That's also the floor where you can take your pets out. 

Overall, great stay aside from that one second rate staff member. This is an autograph collection hotel and their hotels are always designed top notch. I stayed at the Kimpton in SF which wasn't Autograph and it was incredible disappointing lol. Anyway, definitely stay here if you can! It's beautiful and in a great location.

I'm slightly confused because the name here on Yelp is not the name of our hotel at the exact same address: Wyndham Garden Boise Airport. But I see many of the photos and reviews are identical to our experience.

The surrounding area seemed a bit sketchy but that wasn't the problem. The problem was our actual room and the lack of service. 

The beds had visible stains (my bed had a long hair on the sheets). It was so bad I ended up buying sheets, a pillow, and a blanket to use each night. Gross.

The bathroom had no window or fan, so it became an unbearable sauna, difficult to dry off and use the mirror.

We had no hangers in the closet when we arrived. After 5 trips to the front desk, and a full 24 hours later, we were given three hangers.

The TV in the room had lines through parts of the picture and pressing the volume up or down seemed to do absolutely nothing for the volume.

By day 3 of our week-long stay, they cleaning service just stopped. Beds and bathroom basically stayed uncleaned. When we asked the front desk, we were told (by 20 year old ""service"" people) that the cleaners had gone home already. It was a chore to have them even give us new towels. One gal wouldn't even take our old, wet towels. So we just dumped them by the laundry room.

Speaking of the laundry room, we tried to use it near the end of the week. What do you know? It was ""out of service"". Of course it was.

Our room had no window to the outside. Instead, it had a patio door to the indoor pool area. Which might be inviting for some, but it gave us no sense of time of day/night. Anything. And it meant you couldn't open the curtain without anyone in the pool area observing you in your room.

Oh, forgot to mention that our room keys CONSTANTLY stopped working and had to be replaced throughout the week. We each must have had 12 new keys over the course of 6 days. What??

We never tried the Indian Restaurant located on site or their Eureka Lounge  (whatever that was).

The only saving grace was the hotel's proximity to the airport and to 84 (right next to it). 

At any rate, whatever this place is officially called, avoid it. Terrible service and experience.",2021-06-29 04:32:31 UTC,1,0,0,2,U1rcR0MW2jGdAJ8wfWz-tg

Well, let's make it easy and start with the good parts.  It is conveniently located near several historical buildings and sites.  Within walking distance of shopping and dining.  Parking available on site.  Decent sized rooms and amenities.

I'll start this off by saying that I booked this kind of last minute and hoped for the best.  I showed up here and upon check in I was told I was double booked.  I kind of know how this happened, but it was partially the hotel's fault.  There was a glitch in the system that told me I could not book, but in reality it did book me, but just kept kicking me back to the start saying I was unable to book.  So I had to go to a third party site to book the room.  Showing up here they noticed I was double booked, however they did honor the lower of the two prices.  When I went through the check in process I was then directed to parking.

The garage that is attached to this building is scary.  Like it was built and forgot about, kind of like some of the vehicles that are forgotten in the structure.  I swear some of them have been parked there and left for good.  You park, go to the elevator and then have to walk to the front of the hotel to enter.  Once inside it is to your room and left to your own devices.  During my stay there appeared to be several weddings happening as well as some sort of youth sporting event being housed in this hotel.  How do I know it was a youth sporting event?  All the high pitched screams coming from the room next door.  Mostly during the hours when a person was supposed to be sleeping.

The room did offer some great amenities.  I had a fridge and microwave just in case.  Desk area, which came in useful as I had some work to finish before I could go out and discover the city.  However, I did accidentally karate kick the chair when trying to maneuver around the room with the lights off.  I don't think there was enough space between the desk area and beds.  Ample storage for clothing, although it was odd that they had the accordion type of door on the closet.  When I say this, it was like a cloth door that slide left to right.  

The biggest complaint I could have about this place is how close it is to a fire station.  You honestly do not notice this when you check in or when you first enter you room.  You notice this when you realize the windows really don't keep out the noise and the firetrucks keep receiving calls all through the night.  I did get used to this, but only on my last night stay.

The nicest compliment I could have about this place is the vicinity of all the historic places that are a stones throw away.  You have Independence Mall a block up with all it has to offer.  Benjamin Franklin's gravesite is right behind the hotel.  You can walk to Betsy Ross House, Elfreth's Alley, Christ Church, and Museum of the American Revolution.  It is a well placed hotel if you are looking to do a lot of the touristy things Philadelphia has to offer.

Are there some things that could be fixed.  Yes, like the leak that is precisely aimed at the smoking area outside.  But overall, it wasn't that bad of an experience, but also not that great of an experience.",2021-12-28 01:31:02 UTC,3,2,2,7,aahcsguf3tHGIlWn-R1G2Q

With everything being online now a days the app made it really easy to online check in. We could add more towels, shampoo, conditioner, razors and even pick the type of pillow and blanket you wanted for the room. I thought how cool as we are a family of four girls, so we use a lot of hair products and it was nice to have this option. 

Well, I went ahead and added two extra conditioners a razor and two extra towels. Upon arrival the room was very clean and we loved the floors because they were wood. I check the room for the items I reserved online but they were not in the room. Not a problem I called down to the front desk as by now the kids had already used the 1 bottle we had! They said, ""no worries we will have it up to you shortly "" . Did think twice about it. Long story short they never came. The next morning we asked again for the items but this time if they could clean our room as we were headed out for the day.

We returned and they never came to clean the room. Which we had to request because of covid. They also never brought the conditioner and razor. So I tried calling the front desk and the lines were down. So I walked down to address the issue. Asked if they could bring fresh towels , clean the room, and bring the items we requested the day before. Needless to say we never got any fresh towels, never got the conditioner, shampoo or razors and our room was never cleaned!!

I don't feel I asked for much, the staff was friendly but didn't follow though. The only reason they received two stars is because the lady at the front desk with short black hair was very sweet and helpful to my wife during check out. We didn't complain or even tell her about our experience because we were leaving at that point. 

Why have so may option online if you can't follow though with it. Not sure if they are under staffed but asking for basic complimentary toiletries is normal, our room not being cleaned and not getting fresh towels  is totally unexceptionable!",2021-01-04 03:46:19 UTC,2,1,2,2,JZVZm8Agm6po7TQgDh6f3A

Food = 3 stars
Service = 5 stars

I came here for lunch with 5 of my coworkers yesterday for our annual committee Christmas lunch. We had made reservations about a month in advance. I had been here once before about 3 years ago, also during the Christmas season.

The ambiance and decorations for the holidays are magnificent. I highly recommend visiting here just to see them. The food is so-so. I was not impressed 3 years ago with the food. Our visit this time was a bit better.
We were seated at a beautiful round table that overlooked the entrance to the Windsor Court Hotel. It was a pretty day and the view was lovely. The service was very good. All were very attentive and kept our waters and iced teas filled. Following the drink service comes the bread service. They bring rolls and a sort of small muffin-like choice. Each person gets their own plate of 2 pats of butter that are stamped with a fleur de lis imprint on them. It's a nice touch. The breads look very pretty, but were dry and not that flavorful unfortunately.

We all decided to order the plate lunch specials. You choose one main dish and then pick three sides to accompany it. It's basically one big square plate with four small little squares on it with each item. It's a fun concept and you get a variety to choose from. We all more or less got similar choices. I chose the Short Rib as my main choice. It was very good. For my sides, I chose the Gumbo of the day (that day was the Chicken and Andouille). It was decent. I also got the Brussels Sprouts (very good) and the Truffle Macaroni and Cheese (ick..). I did not care for the m&c at all. It was a bit burnt on top and it gave the m&c a bad taste. The rest of my party all enjoyed their plates as well. We were too stuffed for dessert.",2021-12-01 15:05:01 UTC,4,5,0,7,8AFlhlXUXCpA4TzuZLEd2g

On a recent trip to Santa Barbara for UCSB parents weekend, we booked a little late and found Motel 6 to be one of our few options. 

Customer Service: The only real encounter we had with their staff was via phone, when I said we would not need anyone to clean our room between Friday and Saturday.  I was informed they have no housekeeping, LOL. 

The room had two queen beds which was fine for our group of 3, a bathroom with a weird set-up and some space to walk around. The room was not that small, we were fine with the space in #132.  Overall the place was clean; they had a flat screen tv so that was a plus.

Location: I need to give them props for this. They are conveniently located next to many restaurants and super markets. You forgot your toothbrush? No problem, Walgreens is right across the street.  Alcohol?  You got Albertson's right next door and Trader Joe's.  There are also many restaurants and a bowling alley within walking distance.

Motel 6 does play with their prices depending on what is happening on said weekend, I felt $200/night was high all things considered.",2021-11-07 20:08:41 UTC,3,7,7,12,uTu8FjY-KMFHvxeZ68OWCQ

Cons: Not an ""up-to-date"" hotel. 

I did much research prior to booking our hotel for our anniversary trip. My husband had never been to New Orleans so I felt it best to stay in the French Quarter. Many hotels had great ratings on the hotel sites but poor Yelp ratings and if I've learned anything, it's to check Yelp prior to booking any hotel!! 

The night we arrived was a bit unnerving. Check-in was alright. We were given directions as to wear our room was but they weren't great directions so we had to go back to the front desk to check again. Upon arriving to our room we noticed the ac wasn't working. It was cool outside but we were warm from walking all over creation to find the room. We called the front desk and they sent a woman up that seemed to be bitching at us about turning the unit down to much. I painfully expressed to her that this was not how we wanted to start our vacation. She offered to change us to the room next door. Upon moving to the room next door, that ac wasn't working either. 
A maintenance person came up, checked something and left. Another maintenance person came up, checked something and decided a ladder was needed to open vents. That person came back with the wrong size ladder. This guy was polite and probably as annoyed as we were at this point. He apologized and went to get another ladder. He returned with a different ladder and opened the vents. 
He again apologized and said a complimentary bottle of champagne would be brought up. 
We were very pleased by that! It was around 11pm and nothing was open nearby to even grab a cocktail. (Due to covid) 
We did believe it to be a nice gesture and cured our desire to call Hotels.com to share our frustration. 
The following day the staff we encountered was polite and offered suggestions for lunch. We were walking distance to Cafe Du Monde for breakfast but I believe the hotel offered a grab n go type breakfast. 
Overall we were pleased with our stay. I'd recommend booking a regular room as our ""upgraded"" room with a tiny window wasn't worth the money.",2021-01-09 08:34:02 UTC,4,1,1,1,dzU0Z-xOlvZVFgJvthFPEA

We were looking forward to this trip as this was our first family vacay since the pandemic, and our first time in Santa Barbara.  The hotel looked super nice on the website with koi pond, ducks, nice pool, and the price was right.  Read the recent reviews on here, and thought we'd give it a try. I really wanted to like this place, but knew it was too good to be true!  Even with the renovated rooms & price, I don't think I'll be taking my family here again.  Here are the reasons why:
1) Rooms had a weird smell and there was no ventillation;
2) I was told by front desk that none of the bathrooms in any rooms has a vent but ""there is airflow...and at least there is AC""  What?
3) Continental breakfast consist of a brown bag with small water, juice, and muffin.  When we went they were out of hot water and hot cocoa packets, and we were told the hot cocoa will not be replaced, that was all they had.  To-go coffee was located in a small corner, only one guest at a time can serve themselves;
5) No housekeeping AT ALL  Be ready to throw out your own trash, search for your own trash bag, make your own bed each morning, pick up needed towels from the front (coz it will take forever, seems they are under-staffed), and many necessities missing that you're used to having staying in a hotel.
6) They gave a list of vendors where you can receive discounts (restaurants, activities, 2 for 1 wine tastings, etc).  We dined at the listed restaurant, did the SB Trolley Tour, and other activities, but they do not tell you are are supposed to pick up a discount card for EACH of these places before you go.  So we still ended up paying full price.  Why not make it convenient for guests by having them show the hotel key instead and an updated vendor list, instead of requiring yet another card to show at each individual place?  

We ended up cutting our trip short and left a day early.  This is a 1 star hotel.  Will not be back. Very disappointed.",2021-04-05 17:35:48 UTC,1,0,0,0,pWkN6ahGL3-oadBme3e4vQ

First, I will say that I did not book this hotel myself; it was a large group trip & the planner made all reservations. Well I wish I had done some research & booked outside of the group. When we arrived for check in we were unable to because the night manager, Edward H said the reservation was not in our name. He would not let us check in until we facetimed the planner so he could verify her identity etc. This stressed me out because we had just landed late at night & we were worried we would not have a place to stay for the evening. No traveler wants to go through that. I could have probably gotten over that had these other incidents not occurred. The next day when I went to shower, I found a small lizard in the bathtub waiting for me. I guess he needed a shower too. Of course I was skeeved out & immediately called the front desk for assistance. About 7-10 mins later a maintenance man came up & removed the reptile from the room. He was nice about it; a little too nice. Like he had seen & done this lizard removal act before. At this point, I was determined to make the best of  this subpar lodging & get through the rest of my trip. The hotel looks nice enough but due to my experience here, I would not recommend this establishment. The customer service leaves alot to be desired & the cleanliness is questionable at best. Stay here at your own risk, but next time Im in Nola I will try the nicer hotels on Canal Street, just down the road.",2021-11-14 16:02:16 UTC,2,0,0,1,QLEzAJ2u-S8HC8jQfSfmGg

We stayed here, about 5 minutes from the airport. From the breakfast area, I could see the airstrip but without the plane noise. 

While the COVID restrictions were not completely lifted, the hotel still serviced a full hot and cold breakfast: hot and buttery biscuits and gravy, Canadian sausage, scrambled eggs, milk and cereal, yogurt, bagels, muffins, coffee, tea bags, OJ, Apple juice, soda fountains, and oatmeal. All included in the room rate. What an amazing deal!!

Our room had a microwave, small fridge, white and fresh bedding in two queen/full beds. The entire hotel was very clean. 

The lobby next to the breakfast area  had nice comfy seating where my son and I sat and read drinking hot coffee after our sumptuous breakfast while our daughter went back to the room to sleep some more. 

The hotel provided all the comfort and convenience of a home - almost. We checked in on Thursday night and later wanted to stay one more night, but the weekend rate kept going up by 50% while we hesitated. If you want to stay the weekend, reserve early!

Made multiple calls a day to ask them to kindly stop, and the staff told us they couldn't do anything besides have us move rooms. We moved rooms and could still hear the kids running, jumping off of furniture, and yelling. Not to mention, nobody here is considerate and will allow the doors to their rooms slam at all times of the day and night. Parents allow their kids to run up and down the halls. You will 100% hear everything if you decide to stay here. The rooms are very dirty. If you walk around in socks for a few minutes, you'll notice how disgusting they get. The sheets have stains on them. You have to ask for housekeeping to come by because they will not come on their own. We had to ask housekeeping to come by multiple times. There are holes in the walls from people apparently punching through them. We had an issue with the toilet not flushing (tested it with just water) and called the staff for maintenance. They brought us a plunger when we asked for maintenance. They seemed like they didn't really care and just blew us off. The keys to the room do not work 75% of the time. We had to get the keys reprogrammed at least a dozen times. The stovetop and fridge are uneven and wobble around. There are many spots for pets to get stuck in (hole that leads behind fridge) so we had to find a way to cover them up. The breakfast is just okay. They don't have much variety (no pancake/waffle machine). The ""omelettes"" they serve is a weird combination of egg and artificial cheese. No vegetables or meat. The drink machines were down during the entire stay, so only little portable cups of juice were available.

The gentleman that took care of us was very kind and professional. He kept his friendliness and professionalism even after I constantly had to ask him to repeat himself (couldn't understand through his mask) My only issue there was, when I booked my stay, I purposely left my phone number under ""landline"" to avoid the text solicitation. He asked for a mobile number for EMERGENCIES, we of course supplied a number. About an hour or so later, we started receiving unwanted hotel texts. No, it's not THAT major, however, when your away and want nothing to do with your phone, it's a bit annoying. Yes, I could have simply not checked the text but when your screen lights up with ""maybe: Jennifer"" (good ol iPhone) you might NEED to check that to avoid issues with ur spouse. Just saying. Even after NOT replying the texts still rolled in, unwanted. I would have been OK if we were told that the number provided would be to check in about our stay. No need to ask for a number under false pretenses.
Moving onto the room. Very clean and comfortable. The AC was great. Everything worked accordingly.
Parking: when booked, it said parking is available. I'm the type to read the fine print. No it wasn't stated that there was an EXPENSIVE fee for parking. (I booked via Priceline) parking was an additional $35 a night. Still, no problem, nothing is free BUT be aware of the charge.
Moving along, upon checking in, we were asked to leave a $100 deposit for incidentals. No problem with that either, but why wasn't this explained to me when making the reservation? Or even requested at the time of reservation. I paid up front for a reason.
Now here's where it gets annoying, frustrating and the real reason for my 2 star review..
So now, I paid a total of $434.24 on Priceline, upfront. Then I paid an additional $100.00 for incidentals. Then I paid another $70 for parking. I wake up with a text from my bank, I was charged $20.00 at 4:11am. No invoice, no text from ""Jennifer"", just a simple charge. Freedom to randomly charge my card? Of course we call to see what it was for and now I have CHRIS on the phone. Who by the way needs to be taught professionalism and patience..
-Hi, I was charged $20 this morning, can u let me know what that's for please.
He says; sure and proceeds to speed through there very confusing policy. He says, we keep $100 for the incidentals and since u chose to park for two nights, we took your $70 for parking form your incidentals and charged you $20 to keep it $100.
Naturally I said, what that makes no sense.
Note: Especially since I was charged the $20 a day later, after I paid the parking. Anyone would be confused by this.
CHRIS decided to cop an attitude and reply with ""well, if u listen to what I'm saying"" .. No Chris, YOU listen to me.. your policy wasn't explained to me as it should have been the time of parking charges. So maybe you should take a step back and realize that YOUR confusing policy isn't my fault and I'm asking a simple question about where my money went at 4:11am. If the parking and incidentals charges were swapped and that was explained as it should have been, I wouldn't be on the phone with you, now would I be? So maybe, keep your attitude and understand that your co workers didn't do their job effectively and answer my question accordingly.
As you can see, I'm very organized, yes it's only $20 but I want to know where my $20 went. Is that so wrong. We are polite, kind, well mannered people. Our room before check out was practically cleaned for the maids, makes their job easier. Room 1522, go ahead and verify that. What I don't appreciate is your nasty attitude when in fact your confusing policy was the issue.
Would I stay here again, no bc the sneaky, yet justified charges annoyed me and honestly, CHRIS really killed my vibe after speaking to him. Would i recommend, absolutely not. I stay out in Philly 2 nights a month for 7 months, never coming back.",2021-08-08 17:17:56 UTC,1,0,1,2,R6VcB1foXmDhBUxyv2nO9Q

I booked a room so that I could be near the airport when a friend arrived in the morning. First impression was negative; I had a very disappointed 5-yo who wanted to swim in the pool that was closed for the season. No explanation was given other than ""maintenance issues,"" and apparently the other hotels in the area were experiencing similar issues?

The hotel is in need of touch ups/repairs. The hallways are coated in a very dark wallpaper that is chipped and peeling everywhere. The A/C unit in the room was clunky, extremely noisy, and took a good 10 minutes to blow any air, let alone cool air. There is no bathroom door for privacy to use the toilet/shower. The shower door (no tub, just a stall) and floor were in desperate need of a deep clean. The grime was orange and overwhelming. The TV options were limited, and the rental options were ridiculously priced. 

In the lobby, the ""bar"" was never operating, and the convenience food area was extremely limited and overpriced. $6 for a cheap machine coffee with powdered milk is obscene, and it tasted just as bad. 

The receptionist was friendly and kind, and she was likely the one positive from the trip. Thankfully, I only had 1 night here, or else I would have booked elsewhere. 

Truly disappointed as I stayed in an Aloft near the airport in Seattle prior to moving to the east coast, and I liked that location.  I thought that each location would be held to the same standards, but I was wrong.",2021-08-05 04:31:35 UTC,2,2,2,3,X1tdv1fUjjpUwEp6QrJvOA

For this review it was important for me to rate the Rose Garden Inn on two factors. Comparing it to other bargain motel/hotels, and comparing it to all hotels. 

Taking the Rose Garden for what it is vs other motels and it is certainly a 3.5-4 star. The rooms were clean. The employees were helpful and kind. Enough parking for our car. Close to plenty of food options. Each room had working hot water, heater/ac units, mini fridge, microwave, and tv. Floors were clean and rooms had No bed bugs. 

Now comparing it to all hotels it's a 1.5-2 stars. Bed sheets and bath towels may of been clean, but certainly had stains and bleach marks in them. Some of the furniture in the rooms are very worn down and have seen better days 10+ years ago. The dead bolt lock in one room didn't work. 

The Inn certainly appears and looks to be family owned, operated and maintained. 

If you are staying here expecting amenities like the Hilton or Marriott you are setting yourself up for disappointment. However, if you plan to stay here expecting a little above average motel/hotel stay with just what you need then you will be happy.",2021-06-26 20:04:41 UTC,3,0,1,0,hHHlrlKCcFngozLwPj_g7g

1) The rooms were larger and more modern than I expected. The rooms were bigger than the pricer hotels that I usually frequent (coughs the Grand). 


2) I really liked the layout of the rooms and I felt safe there. They had multiple doors that locked without a room key to keep strangers off the street from walking in, they also used an intercom to screen people after hours. As someone who keeps doors locked, I appreciate it. You never know in a hotel who will walk through so locking the doors after hours helps a bit. 

3) Dog friendly without fees! We brought in our blankets and my dog slept on the floor near the bed. She was comfortable and cozy!

4) The rooms were very clean. There's a staff shortage and a lot of hotels are suffering but this one isn't. Everything in our room was spotless. 
As a platinum member of Marriott, and the Hilton, I like nice clean rooms and I feel like I can trust the Westin. 

5) If you aren't from St. Louis and want to be in a safe area or hotel this place is decent.

6) The lobby is great. It has a working fireplace and very comfortable furniture. It's a place to mingle, and enjoy. 

7) The beds were significantly more comfortable than the W, grand, and JW, I'm not sure what they are doing here but I like it! 

8) Customer service was excellent. Honorable mention, Andre's customer service defines what guest expect from a nice hotel. Work hard to keep him Marriott, it's not easy to replace him! 

Areas of opportunity:

1) Valet hours are reduced. If you arrive after hours you will need to park your own car. It's nicer with 24 hour valet, I get it that it's hard to find workers right now but I don't think this is something people want to get use to. Keep in mind it saves the hotel money not to have to pay the overhead cost for valet 24-hours a day but it's a luxury hotel, so shouldn't guest have that option?

2) The restaurant and bar closes early. Again, I think this is because of the reduced traffic and occupancy of the hotel. 

3) They don't have super grand rooms offered. Do you like the surprise Easter egg of hotel rooms that are super large with video games, balconies, and so forth? Well this hotel doesn't seem to have any of those rooms available which is a rarity for a Marriott luxury hotel. Side note: If you don't know about the special rooms in hotels, lol it's a thing.

During this time we drive to the other airport slept on the seats in the waiting area and hung around there for about 12 hours. The next day comes around and we're ready to go on our 8:50 am flight. Come to find out there is ANOTHER delay and after finally boarding we had to wait an HOUR for 40 people to arrive on the flight who had missed the boarding time. So now what was suppose to be an 8:50 am flight turned into a 10 AM flight and we still couldn't make it to our final destination because we missed another connecting flight due to the lack of organization and professional within this company.

We'd walked past it many times on other trips. It's a beautiful old two-story classic road-style motel with vines and a place sit in a common area between the rooms and the parking lot.  

However, beware people!  Notice that the newer reviews (sort by newest first--forget about 2020 reviews) are on average poor.  That's because the Lavender Inn is now a second class citizen to the Brisa Del Mar (part of Santa Barbara Hotels) across the busy Castillo Street.  The Lavender lobby is closed, so if you want a bike, or need anything from the lobby, you have to risk your life running across the street to the Brisa Del Mar, where the lobby is open.   (There are cross-walks on either end of the block but you're in the middle of the block and those are long lights -- you won't want to take the time for a cross-walk.) 

Speaking of Castillo Street, it's busy because it's a feeder to the 101, and loud because muscle cars constantly advertise their eight-cylinder-dual-exhaust machismo.  Better to stay at a place on the quieter adjacent Bath Street, which is a block closer to State but much less traveled.

But here's the worst part, and the reason for two stars: We were bald-faced lied to multiple times by Brisa/Lavender employees.  We had specifically requested a room on the second floor, because we have had horrible nights with Sasquatch clomping around all night above us.   We arrived early, which we had said we would do, hoping for an early check-in.  We were too early (a couple of hours maybe), so the woman at the desk said she would call us when our room was ready.  At a 2:45PM (checking was 3:00PM), we showed up again in the lobby to see if the room was ready.  The woman pointed to a room on the motel map, and I asked if it was on the 2nd floor, and she said no.  I immediately protested, saying we had requested 2nd floor.  She said it's okay, there wasn't going to be anyone on the 2nd floor.  This sounded weird, so my wife asked for clarification.  ""You mean you're not renting rooms on the 2nd floor?""  Correct, the woman said.  So we happily checked into our room. 

Of course, later that night, someone checked into the room directly above us.  I was livid and called the lobby; they said they don't know why the woman would said that because that room was reserved when she assigned us our room.  The person in the lobby said they would make an ""adjustment"" to our room charge.  

The next day we talked to the woman of interest, and she denied the whole conversation (however, my wife and I both explicitly remember it).  We stayed our three nights with someone directly above us each night (although admittedly it wasn't Sasquatch).

I just checked my credit card charges, because a receipt was never sent to us (really?  why not?  I got all kinds of emails prior but no record of the final charges to my card?).  Guess what.  There was no adjustment to our room charge.",2021-04-19 00:11:44 UTC,2,0,0,0,AB8g_-OrkdqqK0VXZ6i7-w

We made our reservation for a king room on May 14th-May 17th through Booking.com (which is never really a good idea but we were in a time crunch), so we didn't closely review all of the amenities or the policy on pets in depth. That was our fault without a doubt. When we walked in with our two dogs the guy at the front desk was less than welcoming and informed us we were over the maximum pet limit. That's fine. My attitude toward the situation then was to try and find a solution to the issue. I asked ""What are our options?"" hoping he'd offer some suggestions.

Zero service, just a straight forward check in.  Nobody to help with luggage, etc.
Covid used as an excuse for not providing service.  Rooms are not cleaned, beds made etc unless requested.  I requested twice, but was never done.

- Valet was hit or miss. Often times the post was unmanned, and if valet was full, we were told to ""park it ourselves"" in the garage. Why would we pay to park it in the garage if we already paid for the valet parking?
- Shower takes 35 minutes to heat up. Our room, and my MIL's room was the same. When we called down to the front desk, the only solution was ""wait a bit longer"". Really? Glad we were showering at night and didn't have anywhere to be in a hurry!
- Our bathroom retained a weird ""water park"" smell for the duration of our stay. No solution for that either. 
- This property is overpriced for what it offers. It is in desperate need of a revamp to continue to compete with its neighbors. Our ""leather"" desk chair was rubbed down to the bone, rips in the couch, just really old and run-down looking. It is in poor condition.

This property and staff are not going out of their way for any additional cleaning measures, only about 20% are wearing masks, common areas extremely dirty, rooms dusty, if you are looking for a hotel that takes the pandemic seriously, this isn't it.",2021-12-28 16:54:02 UTC,3,0,0,0,CEt5I8Y0RSrxb_r-y3jxeg

The lobby is beautifully decorated and their were disposable masks and hand sanitizer for the guests.  The bar is lovely and uniquely decorated, although the bartender on Friday night seemed a bit anxious and struggled with engaging us positively.  The hotel is located very close to Bourbon Street and in walking distance of Canal Street.  Here is what didn't work...

The room made available to us didn't meet our expectations, even though we booked the room online.  There was a mold smell in the room, the desk chair was rickety and there was no paper and pen on the desk, which was odd.  The hotel didn't appear to have ice machines or vending machines on any of the floors where the rooms were located.  The advertised breakfast was not available and we were told the vendor suddenly ended their relationship with the hotel.  As a result, there is no room service at the hotel.  

We weren't successful in advocating for a different room as we were advised the entire hotel was booked.  While the staff were friendly enough, that experience isn't enough to get us to book again with this hotel or to recommend it to our friends and family.  

We're hopeful the misses were related to the pandemic and as travel resumes the quality of stay will improve as well.",2021-05-18 04:46:45 UTC,3,0,1,5,t7479-6d-PZPaXrEz9bvmA

I was to have a short layover in Nashville before heading on to Pensacola. Upon our approach to Nashville a terrible storm arose and my flight was diverted to Louisville, Ky. We sat on the runway in Louisville for quite some time. When the weather cleared Southwest flew us back to Nashville. Needless to say I missed my connecting flight, and there were no other available flights out that night so I was forced to spend the night in Nashville. To their credit Southwest Airlines did hand out hotel vouchers, but after doing research I chose not to go with the hotels accepting the vouchers and chose this Marriott.

I didn't do it for snobby reasons, by this time it was 11:30 at night, and I was going to have to head back to the airport at 5:00 am, so it was a matter of convenience and safety. As a woman traveling alone I am very safety conscious, and some of the motels that accepted the voucher were ""sketchy"" and had bad reviews to say the least.

This Marriott had a shuttle which was nice, especially late at night and early in the morning to head to the airport. The gentleman who checked me in was very pleasant. I was stressed and exhausted but had a glass of wine at the restaurant bar to help me unwind.

The room was spacious, clean and updated. Loved the floors!!! I really was only there to sleep, as I was on the shuttle back to the airport at 5:00 am (ugh). This was a very nice hotel, and maybe I can come back someday and spend some time.",2021-01-17 16:20:41 UTC,4,2,1,5,xT5suz2IOLPVt9Y8r00QVg

It was hot, I had been doing some outdoor stuff, and my car's a/c is broken. As I headed home to Sarasota I was looking around for some familiar place that wasn't fast food where I could stop for a cool drink and food, and get out of the heat. I spotted Bob Evans.

I was greeted, shown to a table, and given a menu. My server came right over and I quickly requested water and a soft drink. She got me those, and for the rest of my visit she took very good care of me, checking with me often to bring me more to drink. The food part also went well, taking only about 8 minutes.

When I think of Bob Evans I think of their slow roasted Pot Roast. Where else can you find tender, delicious pot roast? And when I saw they had a new Double Cheese Pot Roast Dip sandwich, I ordered it.

Man, what a good sandwich. I know I was hungry and pretty wiped out from the heat, but that sandwich was so, so good. Delicious pot roast, so much cheese, brown gravy for dipping? Wow, so good. The sourdough bread was an excellent choice, I should mention the bottom slice was pretty soggy which made it a messier sandwich. The gravy also worked well for dipping my fries.

I am writing with a complaint about my visit at your hotel.
The first night I stayed, there was no room service the next morning.
There were only 2 towels and the shower in room 212 backs up and doesn't drain, so the next person who showers has to stand in about 4"" of the previous person's shower water as it takes about an hour to drain.
I went to the front desk to let them know. He said we have to request maid service if we want it. That is such a ridiculous policy for a hotel, I've never heard of that, and how would we even know? Trash cans are overflowing the shower needs looked at, and although he gave me new towels, we needed more.  I asked to talk to the manager, but there was no manager there. He said there was no one there to give maid service at that time, so I requested maid service for the next day.
We never got it.
When I went down to the desk, the man working said that someone had quit and he couldn't have the room made up for us, again. I tried to speak to the manager, but again, there was no management on site.
So we had a three night 4 day stay with no maid service. I had to keep emptying trash by the elevators and going downstairs to get towels. And the whole time, only the first person who showered had a clean shower.
The whole experience was completely unacceptable. And seeing that management was never on site to talk to, it seems the hotel is completely mismanaged.",2021-05-26 05:16:12 UTC,1,0,1,2,AihZL0Vrfm1QPfHJS_KkEg

Once in the room had paneling brown walls! Old carpet, a nice size TV in the living room ONLY! Just wait for the horrible BATHROOM AND SHOWER! 
The couch was nice and comfortable, the kitchen had the basic but the tile on the floor was cracked and loose. Oh that's right the mini refrigerator for a 2 bedroom apartment couldn't fit a lot in the fridge. 
The bedroom was nice size with a good mattress just no TV in either bedroom. 
The grand bathroom was a nasty, under the sink, no counter space in the bathroom but a table and mirrors on the outside of the bathroom. Then the purple oval jet bath tub which had dirty jets, you had to walk up 2 steps to get in the bath tub jacuzzi to take a shower. Thank God for water shoes!
The outdoor sitting area was on the roof which was nice and small. The other area was the pool which was nice as well!

We were really excited. We arrived at checkin time and the front desk girl was less than welcoming. She asked for the pins. I had purchased these vouchers months ago. She sat dryly expecting me to understand what she meant. Since I thought this was all taken care of in the reservation stage, I was confused. I had to pry out what she needed. After receiving our keys, I told my friends this clerk needed some customer service training badly. She is not cut out for face to face service with people. Management/owners would do themselves a huge boost to this boutique hotel to either train their staff properly or hire people with people skills. 
First impressions are huge. The rooms were remodeled but not terribly clean. I'm a stickler on a hotels cleanliness. The bathroom floors were dirty or stained. The hallway wasn't vacuumed. It's hard not to have a newly renovated place not look perfect but they have. 
I use Travelzoo to try new places. I worked in the travel industry for 30 years and travel usually once a month when times are normal. I will not recommend this place nor return. Too bad, your marketing efforts via Travelzoo have been wasted.

We went down to the restaurant - which was packed with a single employee running everything. She was polite and attentive but there were about 30 people in there. The front desk staff was nice.

Parking was slightly higher than listed on the reservation. Checkout was borderline impossible with one person working the desk and a line almost to the restaurant so we had to use the key drop.

1. Close to Vanderbilt
2. Mostly attentive staff
3. Rooms were comfortable. Microwave, fridge freezer and even a electric stove if anyone would be thinking of cooking. Construction was going on opposite the street on Vanderbilt but the noise was muted in the room where we stayed
4. Currently they have started serving hot breakfast again. 
5. Free shuttle to downtown where they drop and pick up at Broadway and 7th ( I think)
Cons-
1.Parking costs an extra $32. If have AAA can get it slightly slashed down if you book the park and stay package
2. Demand drives up prices and with swimming and baseball school teams staying in the hotel the prices were dear the week/weekend we stayed. :)
3.  The front desk person named Paul was consistently rude and unhelpful any time I approached him with a question.

The coffee is terrible (not surprised). Your breakfast is not much better than a school lunch. It is packed in a brown paper bag and you get a pastry, a room temp apple, and some mediocre orange juice. The TV's are from the early 2000's and barely work. There is no free wifi. I had to use my own pillow because the ones they had were terrible. There is a popcorn ceiling with a carpet which is clearly in bad condition. The people hanging around the hotel looked like drug dealing scumbags. The only thing I liked about this hotel in comparison to the others was the pool. It felt great to jump into after a long, hot day, but even the pool was a bit dirty on the surface. Overall, I would recommend you spend a little bit more on a Hampton Inn or something similar. I stayed in a Hampton Inn and received much better service, a nicer room and bathroom by far, an indoor pool and hot tub, a full breakfast with decent coffee, a laundry room, a gym, and to top it off, they offered snacks and food all day plus delivery. I would give that Hampton Inn a solid four star review. So in comparison, I have to give this a one star.

There is a possibility I've entered the twilight zone, or am still hiking Bruneau Dune, lost and delirious.
As I pulled up to the inn that I quickly booked because of the price three hours earlier, there were three cop cars in the parking lot, and one K-9 unit sniffing around a car. Obviously no place is safer than with the cops already there, so I park and go to the lobby for the room key. When I enter I feel like I might have come to the wrong place because I booked at the Ramada, and the doors say Hotel Inn, which sounds like a fake hotel. But my reservation went through their machine, and went to my room, walking by a little girl play with two cops. 
My room was slightly unclean and smelled of cigarettes, but I was tired and needed to wash sand off my feet, so I didn't care. But after redressing I decided I needed to explore the place. When I went back out into the hallway I notice how the ceiling was only around six and half feet tall, about a foot shorter than in the rooms. The pool area was my first stop, and it was amazing. The water hadn't been swam in or cleaned for months by the look of it. The hot tub was cold. There was an athletic room with a tv and sound system that wouldn't work. Behind the pool, a billiards table sat in front of a facade of a suburban house built into the building. A lot of furniture and tiles were being loaded into the facade. TVs, chairs and desks were being stacked in huge piles in the next room. And the whole place seemed abandoned. I walked around the empty conference rooms, staring at the piles of usable equipment and amenities and wondering why they are now seeming trash. 
I then decided to eat at the Indian place inside the hotel, pretty good give it a solid 4/5. Noticed while eating a guest arguing with a staff member in the lobby. The while returning to my room the whole place became too much. It had an aura to it that suggests that you have exited the real world. The only time you are pulled back into the real is when you notice ""hey there's a bunch of sketchy looking dudes just hanging out outside."" But if you can ignore that inconvenience I would recommend you come here, the place is like no other!

Pros: good location, staff was very friendly and helpful (not they're fault the place is poorly taken care of.) 
Couches in living room were comfortable. Great hot water and good pressure. 
Cons: No hotel parking, luckily Harrahs a few blocks away had a free parking special for card members. Street parking is expensive.
Bedroom wall sockets were so worn out phone plugs kept falling out randomly, bed cover had bleach stains on it, beds were on the harder side which is a con for us but not everyone. Bedrooms also don't have AC so if doors are closed you'll roast. Kitchen was fair size but had awful spell coming from sink, stains and cracks in countertop, mini fridge door wouldn't open all the way due to the slanted floor, tiles in kitchen were cracked and separated.

We stayed 2 nights for NYE and also dined in the Trillium restaurant to celebrate our anniversary-staycation. 
See my separate review of the restaurant. Spoiler, it was fantastic!
Cons;
Not much seating available in the hotel lobby, unless you want to sit in the cocktail bar area, but that was overrun on NYE, so just 2 small chaises near the frigid front doors. Hotel was overrun with children for a hockey event and with children comes lots of noise; not the best ambience for a classy hotel. I saw kids roller skating in the halls and elevators. High decibel screams from the kids in the pool area, made it impossible to relax, although the staff did the bests they could to keep them reined in. I never understand why hotels do not have sound absorbing materials on the ceilings in pool areas. The clothes closet in our room didn't have a stopper, so it slammed loudly with each use. Bathroom in room had a quite low toilet, low tub and the air exhaust in the ceiling was caked with dust. I can't believe that it is ever cleaned, as this much dust looks like years of accumulation. Toilet paper rolls were difficult to reach when seated unless you are a contortionist. All hotel bathrooms suffer from inadequate hooks/bars in the bath. A large blank wall would have benefitted from a towel bar and several hooks. mini-fridge was barely cool. Banging sounds from kids in the room above us were unbelievable loud, but a call to the front desk quickly stopped the noise.
Pros;
Most of the staff (except one cleaner we encountered in the elevator) were very professional and friendly. We got a warm greeting from the assistant front office manager, Helyn De Haan, in the form of a lovely letter congratulating our anniversary and included a bottle of Prosecco on ice. They also offered to confirm we had a room with a great view, which it was, from the 12th floor. Mattresses were firm and perfectly comfortable as we like. Bedding & pillows were all clean as was the entire room. Ample USB charging ports were available around the room. Beautiful wall treatment behind the beds, without any cheesy artwork to distract the peace. Cleaners do not enter daily, only upon request, which is how we prefer. Real hangers were in the closet for use and although there isn't a sundries store in the lobby, they did provide to me a free toothbrush with toothpaste as that was the one item I had forgotten to pack. The shower was quite spacious and powerful. Water temperature was great and the provided lotions were all top notch.
Pool and gym area is well equipped and they offer outside memberships as well. The person at the front desk was so perky and friendly, I want to get a membership just so that I can interact with her again!

I'll start with the good because it's a short list. The staff are excellent. So kind and courteous. And the room was clean*. We reserved a club room and in short it was a closet. My college dorm room was bigger than this. To start there were only two pillows on the bed which seems ridiculous. The bathroom was so tiny. The shower awkwardly laid out. THERE IS NO DRRSSER. we have 1 night stand with three small drawers and a small closet with minimal hangers. So we had to live out of our suitcases. There is a sliver of a window to allow some natural light. When my partner woke up they were hungry and considered ordering from room service when we flipped on the TV, which is where we saw the dining option, we saw that the only options that were listed were local restaurants and delivery so basically both options suggested delivery. Also the TV streaming services were confusing to the point where we decided to not use them. The parking is not on site but it's not far away and it is somewhat costly and you can't move your car as you choose without the cost skyrocketing. The duvet cover made absolutely no sense and completely slipped off the duvet insert in the middle of the night me and my partner then got tangled in the duvet cover and we were freezing all night. Unfortunately we didn't realize that the comforter was a duvet with a duvet cover and used for sometime just the insert. It wasn't until we were covered in fluff that we realized what we thought had been a sheet was in fact the duvet cover. Who knows how long is been since the actual duvet insert was cleaned gross. The duvet cover We asked for a second comforter because the comforter is insanely small and were denied and a throw blanket was provided. The desk is not large enough for any real work and is more like a hutch that is bolted to the wall. All in all the state was horrendous. It was listed on Priceline as a four-star hotel and had no pool, the vending machines only took cash, and the elevators were incredibly small.

Room plus $35/day parking cost $1200.00 for 3 nights. Room is very small. No closet or dresser for clothes. Does have a few wood pegs to hang clothes.
Bathroom door is a barn door but has no end stop so when you open it it comes off the rail and has to be lifted back in place. The toilet seat screws were very loose so when you use the toilet the seat moves.
The towel rack is over thIe toilet and when I got up the first morning one of the bath towels was in the toilet soaked. Asked for new towels and the front desk/bar they are the same, clerk acted put out and said someone would deliver. Did get them in about 5 mins. It takes a long time to get any hot water for sink and shower.
Morning coffee provided if you can get it. First morning went down at 10 sorry we stop serving at 10. Did not bother the second day. On our way out went to get coffee at 6 sorry went start at 6 have to wait till ready. We left.
Free drink tokens yeah right! Only if you choose a drink of their choice or beer. I wanted vodka and cranberry nothing exotic but no only drinks of their choice.
Not sure if it is generational but most of the staff is down tight sparky. I am more use to the staff being friendly at least.
Unfortunately there is a large homeless population that hangs out around the restaurants and bars. Asking for money and some a little aggressive if you don't give them money. City Pub had 12 or more homeless standing around and looking in at people inside.  Fighting with each other and lots of yelling between the homeless. Little scary at times.

Unfortunately, we walked out at 6am the next morning to find that someone had sliced right through the straps which secured the storage unit on top of my car which contained my entire wardrobe & some items of sentimental value.

My sister & I had to stop here overnight to get some rest because I was moving from CA to TX. We were worried about my rooftop storage which contained my entire wardrobe but because I am disabled & we were exhausted from driving, taking everything down with us into the hotel wasn't feasible (especially with a 2nd floor room). We specifically picked this hotel because it seemed less sketchy than some of the other places in the area. Although I do think this place was safer than some of the other hotels, I think we had a false sense of security when we saw a security person walking around the parking lot & we didn't notice people loitering in the parking lot like we saw at other locations. Fortunately, they did not break into my car to access anything else & we made sure to bring our electronics with us but this was a huge loss for me as I am about to start a new job & now have to deal with buying an entirely new wardrobe while facing significant mobility impairments which make shopping very difficult, especially during this pandemic because I am immune compromised.

Note: I was parked on the disabled parking spot at the back corner of the hotel which is right in front of the back door entrance. We informed the hotel of what happened the next day & they said they would check the security cameras but on follow up they said the cameras couldn't even see the luggage or anything significant. This is honestly questionable due to the location of my vehicle which was parked in the disabled parking spot that is directly in front of the back corner gate entrance. If this particular parking spot is not visible to their security camera, no other parking spot is remotely visible & you can be sure your vehicle is completely unprotected.

I just want travelers to be mindful that any external luggage/storage which is not affixed to your actual vehicle is not going to be safe (no matter how large/heavy you think it is). Be sure to take precautions with anything pertinent or sentimental (I lost my doctoral graduation cap, some culturally significant traditional clothes & my entire wardrobe).

These thieves had to be well prepared for this sort of theft & must've had a large vehicle (so don't think anything is too big to be taken). My rooftop luggage storage unit was well secured with heavy duty moving straps which were cleanly sliced with a blade. It was also much too big to fit into any car, moving the entire rooftop storage quickly would've been much too heavy to be done alone.

I hope this review can at least help someone else avoid a major loss & perhaps the hotel can take some security precautions to help future travelers prevent or deter theft. Please consider at least installing parking lot security cameras or signs warning travelers to be cautious with oversized cargo that cannot be locked (& verbally advising travelers to take precautions would also be very kind). I honestly would've been willing to pay extra for some sort of secure storage option for this type of cargo or would've at least taken down what I could had I considered they might just take the entire storage unit.

As far as the hotel stay goes, it was a pleasant stay & staff was polite & courteous. The beds were VERY comfortable & the pool & hot tub looked nice (we almost went in but were just much too tired). We were generally very pleased with the comforts of our stay here. The only complaint is that the tub could've been better cleaned. My sister wanted to take a warm bath, but was not comfortable when she noticed several lingering hairs in the tub.

Regarding accessibility: the hotel did not have any first floor accessible rooms the evening of our stay but I did notice that they had a chair lift available on the staircase closest to our room for anyone who could not walk the stairs independently. The only elevators were only located at the front of the hotel. Another note, there were no ice & vending machines in the back (where our room was located) so I had to walk all the way to the front to get some water to take my medications for my night & morning doses. Our unit did have multiple bars in the bathroom which I found helpful for getting in & out of the tub after our long trip.",2021-05-03 21:16:09 UTC,2,0,0,0,wAJoduiX9tFGmmJZB3IXyA

Had a bigger room with a tv, microwave and fridge in both main bedroom and lounge. The hot tub was nice and hot, and the huge pool was heated. The lagoon surrounding the pool area was verdant and relaxing, there were several cute ducks (with feathers on their heads that looked like shower caps). Would definitely stay here again. 

Enjoyed the pool in the evening while waiting for some other guests to clear out of the hot tub, but they never did. These inconsiderate people were my main problem with our stay and one of the most frustrating aspects of living in COVID times (and pre-covid times, of course, but come on, let's be respectful to each other and take turns doing stuff if that's what's required). They ignored the hotel's COVID guidelines: 30 minute limit, no more than 7 people total, social distance, and only one person or one group from the same household allowed. There were 3 couples and their children (from different households, from separate locations), and they hogged the hot tub for almost two hours in the evening.

The next morning, we went to get a few minutes in the hot tub when it opened, and, after 20 minutes there, the dad from one of the same couples from the night before came to the pool area, dropped off his four kids (all under 10 years old), and left them unsupervised. I guess he thought my wife and I and an older couple at a table having coffee were cool to babysit. We eventually saw the dad re-emerge and watch them from his second floor balcony. I know I probably sound like I'm some rigid jerk, but I'm exhausted of this inconsiderate behavior.

Unfortunately the service was not.  We waited 20 minutes at check in with no one to be found.  They had 1 person on staff and she had to grab extra towels and deliver them to a room.  The housekeeping does not provide enough supplies to the room.  We had two sinks in two separate rooms and a shower with only 1 bar of soap and 1 hand towel.  We did have 3 full size towels.  4 pillows, but no extra pillows or blankets in the huge walk in closet.  

Beautiful sitting area in a very large room.  Very tastefully decorated and very comfortable to hang out in the room.  We didn't use the pool or fire pits, but they looked very nice, but again no one to be seen.  The TV was tiny for such a long view from the bed.  The restaurants were minimally staffed, and the ""grill"" was CROWDED.  Bar keep was very kind while we waited for our sub par food.  The food was unimaginable and prepared half heartedly.  The Cuban sandwich was the size of a snack bruschetta.  It was slapped together sloppily with no accoutrements.  The salad was not constructed, four piles of ingredients with no dressing.  Other than the Ritz, we've come to expect poor food in Tucson. 

The golf was disappointing.  They booked us, unbeknownst to us, on the lesser course.  It is MUCH lesser as it's very short with a few tricks tee to green, but the greens are devilishly stupid to increase the slope.  The golf shop, rangers and ""members"" also had a rude attitude.  Like we should be thankful just to be on their course.  Go play Ventana Canyon, the course is much better and the people even more so.  Just not as nice a room.

The lower level the staff the nicer they were.  As they were management or more experienced they were uncaring.  Probably beat down by a cheap operator.  They keep the course in great shape for the members.",2021-04-06 07:22:00 UTC,3,0,0,0,TZEbzzZqTz4qsLoj_C6FCg

As I was admiring this, I noticed the hideous steel beams beside me (an eyesore) and beneath them, dripping water is slowly filling a bucket in the lobby.

This is the Clayton Plaza Hotel.  It's very confused. The lobby is posh, but outdated. The chandeliers are pretty and sit above the most random decor you could ever think of. (Blue feathers in weird jars? Check. A weird print out of the wait times at the restaurant on a dry erase sheet? Check.) There is a grand staircase covered by terrible carpet. Oak doors next to a dark metal walkway. Wallpaper EVERYWHERE, on every possible surface. Horrific carpet, lovely lamps.  Gone with the Wind Curtains next to Walmart microwaves. Antique furniture next to Pier One chairs?    Yes, yes, yes. This hotel is a rich woman who let her gawdy friend dress her.

It's all so confusing.  Free breakfast is nice, but the restaurant needs a major overhaul as it has a straight-up 90's lounge vibe. Our room is fine, it's FINE (the beds are comfy at least), but the showers have very little water pressure and the controls are somehow the opposite of intuitive (Hot means cold, red means chilly, turn it all the way around to get started, move backwards to make it hotter.) 

The staff, however, is five star worthy: each one has been super helpful, kind and good at explaining what needs to be done (like the complicated parking situation.)  The restaurant staff is stellar and so friendly, the front desk is as well, and even our maitenence guy who came to change a bulb was helpful and polite.  

The POOL is another story.  We booked this hotel solely for the pool since we have a little one who needs to get his energy out every day.  The pool is very gross. It's downstairs in this strange room that will remind you of the weird youth centers of the 80's.

It reeks like mildew and chlorine, which was so heavy in the water that it gave me a rash after my first swim. The inside pool section is nasty - you won't want to be in it as it's full of dead bugs. The outdoor section is far better, but quite small.  Of everything in the hotel, this needs the updated the most; it's just GROSS. We all felt like we needed a shower afterwards - the water and the room just didn't seem clean. (Also, the old game center next to the pool seems like it hasn't been cleaned or vacuumed since the 80's. DO NOT ENTER.)

As for the location, it is perfect. Literally. It's an easy walk away from some of the best restaurants in Clayton, it's close to Forest Park and any downtown business in Clayton. You truly can't beat the location and the parking.  

Basically, this is a hotel that has nothing but potential. It has the location, it has the bones, but it needs someone with just a little bit of vision to take it to a four-star level.  Like, buy some new pillows! Take down the wallpaper! Put in hardwood floors!!  AND FOR GOD'S SAKE, DEMOLISH THE POOL AND START OVER.",2021-10-06 23:50:25 UTC,3,0,0,0,5NIAluJfU7O5YzHxtLQ_OA

This hotel desperately needs renovated and had I realized for nearly the same price I could have been at a newer property I would have done so. The room was musty, the walls are alarmingly thin to where I could hear the person above me moving around and the person in the room next to me clearing their throat. The phone in my room did not work so I had to call the front desk from my cell phone which is pretty ridiculous. The air conditioner made loud rattling sounds and the bathroom counters even had stained rings on them. 

   I'm a Hilton Honors member and should have paid a bit more to stay at the Hilton at the Arch just down the street as this wasn't even comparable. Just a gross building and I'm shocked I paid as much as I did to stay here for 3 nights. 

Also, be forewarned that they'll say you're free to use any type of card (e.g., debit, credit) at check in but they do not inform you until after you swipe that if you use a debit card the total amount and an additional $40/night ""holding fee"" is applied which will be removed from your available balance immediately and then you have to wait for the holding fees to drop off your account up to 5 days after. The man at the desk was not friendly when I asked why I had a pending charge posted to my checking account for the larger sum, he scoffed at me then said ""in the six years I've been working here no one has asked about this.""",2021-06-05 14:50:19 UTC,3,0,0,1,30f3N48UUGh0YELCZGKmvw

Third day- no new towels so I called down to get towels, shampoo, conditioner, soap. The women on the phone said it would be an hour as they had run out of towels. 

Fourth day- at hotel ""Luxury"" lol!!! The toilet started to overflow and yes fecal matter and urine ran over the sides and onto the floor. Did I mention we had called previous to this to let them know the toilet was overflowing?? 

Fifth day- the tub started to back up. Basically, we were taking showers in a tub that had a 1 foot, yes 1 foot of backed up DIRTY water IN IT. Called the front desk again. They didn't even show one flicker of interest in our problem. These people are absolutely nuts, I say to myself!!

During my stay, the tub had standing water and was rather filthy (even after I wiped it down) there were what looked like vomit stains on the carpet and the wallpaper in ceiling was old and peeling. 

We also had noisy neighbors, which isn't in the hotel, but I wished our rooms were further a part from other guess simply because it is still COVID. 

I've stay here for work and pleasure, really given it a good go, but I can no longer choose this as my preferred hotel. It's just not up to snuff.",2021-05-15 15:05:16 UTC,1,0,0,1,qaxZy6vxyat2VH_rJ0BD6Q

This is an older Drury Inn but its well kept and has lots of amenity's. It also has a Applebee's attached to it. I was impressed with the complimentary breakfast bar. The food is always fresh and lots of options. They also give you a drink card for adult beverages. You can get up to four drinks free. With the drinks they also have an all you can eat snacks bar from 5pm to 7pm. Its usually pasta, nacho's, chicken tenders, hot dogs, and chili to name a few. If a person was trying to save money you could actually eat two of your three meals here for free. I personally only take advantage of the breakfast. We usually like to find restaurants to try while traveling.

The rooms are always nice and the bathrooms are very clean. If I had to pick something to improve. It would be the bathrooms. They could use some updating but again they are very clean. The only other thing that irritated me. Was they ran out of ketchup on the first day and didn't bother to send someone to the store and pick up a bottle. I am a stickler with my ketchup! If you are going to serve food make sure you have condiments. This Drury was also located in a very nice area. There are some shady spots around St. Louis if you don't pay attention.

First off, the parking alone was $30 and to get to your room, you have through this weird stairs and hallway that's open to non-residents and extremely creepy. As a woman, this is a huge red flag when I first arrive to a hotel. 

When entering the hallways to get to your room you are overcome with gloom because of the dimness and depressing color scheme. I got the immediate feeling of... what the hell did I just pay for... also, it smells like a mix of old meatloaf and pennies. Yum! 

The rooms are just awkward. It is almost as if they chose random decor from an expired Kohl's catalog and called it a day. To put it simply, the color pallet as well as the choice of furniture is nauseating. Additionally, it's a bunch of empty space and awkward dimensions. It's unsettling... At this point of my experience, I just thought i was being too critical and finished unloading my stuff. 

AND THEN, the turning point of my stay and the spawn of this nasty Yelp review. This room was disgusting, the carpet looked as if it hadn't been vacuumed in a month with food, and dog kibble, all over the floor. But folks, here is my favorite part- there were RAT DROPPINGS on the floor, or whatever the hell were these tiny brown balls were,  (pictured below for your viewing pleasure ). Isn't that just lovely? And if it couldn't get any worse, there was CHEWED GUM on the top of the cap of the water bottle that you can purchase for an ungodly price. (Also below!) What the hell man. Disgusting. Why? Why? 

At this point, it was just comical at how much they f**cked up with this hotel room. How does this hotel stay in business? Look at the other reviews and you will find other experiences that bring up the same stuff and some other things I don't mention here (like the way they catfish this hotel online, the price, how they double charge you, etc). Oh and by the way, even the wifi is sketchy, my MacBook gave me a security warning upon first connecting to it. I immediately disconnected from it when the image below popped up. 

My family and I immediately checked out and thankfully, they gave us our money back with no problems. I will be closely monitoring my bank statements however. 

So overall, a great place to stay if you are having a mid life crisis and want to be overcome with gloom and the smell of pennies. Thanks!",2021-06-15 23:01:26 UTC,1,1,1,1,YneonfbL8f-eN7OjyP09tg

The people above us woke up at 3am and sounded like they were running back and forth in their room for an hour. There was some sound like a washing machine or maybe the pool filter that was very loud all night long. We heard multiple dogs barking in the night. Overall just a terrible experience. 
I bought on a third party site and paid $150. That was even too much for this place.",2021-01-17 19:52:50 UTC,2,0,0,1,ca5T-1_UX_Lpzcnl27wLVg

I've been to virtually every other Marriott brand, but for some reason had never been to one of these. 

The first thing I noticed is how dark the place is- lobby, hallways, rooms, all primarily dark colors with some pops of vibrant color. Definitely different from the eat Marriott designs their other brands where everything is a shade of gray. 

While I understand they normally have some food or drink service, unfortunately this was not open during my recent trip due to what I suspect is slower business due to COVID. Thankfully there are plenty of restaurants and bars within the immediate vicinity, and it was just a short walk.

To say that this place was underwhelming would have been the understatement of a lifetime! So, I go to check into my 2 rooms that I had reserved about 2 weeks prior to my arrival (there were 5 adults in our group), and even though I had called them twice to first request and then confirm that they'd be adjoining rooms, the front desk clerk promptly hands me keys to 2 rooms on DIFFERENT FLOORS! She said (I kid you not) that they are adjoining rooms, right next to each other! Yeah, one of them is on the 8th floor and the other is on the 7th floor, but sure, right, they are virtually next door to each other! At this point, I'm thinking 0-stars for the rating...but it gets worse, way worse. 

This should have been the first red flag for this dump of a hotel...but, then we say we're going to self-park the single vehicle (all of us rode together). The lady hands me the hotel keys and then gives me directions to the garage, saying to drive to the 7th floor so that we can park close to the first room. We get out of the car after parking up there, and walk to the door--there are stairs...so much for one member of our party who cannot handle stairs very well--and so much for any ADA requirement that says that folks in wheelchairs or the physically disabled should be able to get into their hotel room...We walk in and go up the half-dozen steps. We get to the first room, and say good night to the first 3 members of our group. 

Then I hop on the elevator with my wife and we push the button for the 8th floor. The doors close very slowly and with a lot of creaking and groaning of the mechanism...and we sit there. Nothing happens. We push the buttons for the 9th and 10 floors. Those lights go on, but still the elevator doesn't move. We push the button for the lobby--still no movement. We push the open button. Nothing. The doors remain close and now we're stuck in a hotel elevator at 11pm...After hitting the emergency button (which should sound an alarm...but it does not) and then pressing the open button frantically for about 5 minutes, the door finally opens and we're back where we started--on the 7th floor. So, we go trudging to the opposite end of that floor to find the stairs up to the eighth floor. Two full flights of stairs--about 10-12 in each set, to get up to the 8th floor...dragging our suitcase behind us. It's now 11:15pm and we're finally arriving into our hotel room. A mere 30 minutes after checking in. Wow! What a great place! 
 
Once in the room, I call the front desk to tell them that their elevator is broken. No luck...because the phone is too. No dial tone, no one to call. So, I pick up my cell phone and call the front desk the old fashioned way--from an external phone to the hotel. Some lady answers and proceeds to tell me how it was my fault that they elevator didn't work. Clearly I had not waited long enough between closing the elevator doors and then pushing the floor button. Yeah, like that was the issue. As for the phones, she said that they often turn them off at night so as to not disturb other guests or the front desk! Huh? Say what? Crazy place. 

So, in the morning we push the elevator button for fun (nothing happens), and then we repeat the process in reverse...dragging our luggage back down to the 7th floor and out to the car. We tell our family about our elevator issue, and we get a similar story from them--they tried to go down to the workout room at 7am. Got on the elevator and after a few minutes it did go down to the 1st floor...where it stayed without opening for nearly 5 minutes. Then someone helped them pull the doors open and they got out. They were so frazzled by the elevator, that they simply walked back up the stairs to the 7th floor as their exercise. 

We drive down and I go do the checkout process. I tell the front desk person about our collective experiences to which they reply ""user error. Everything you said is false and the equipment all works--you must not understand how to work a phone or an elevator"". Nice. Then I get the bill for the rooms. Both of the rooms had 2 queen beds in them--at a rate of $101 per night. First room with tax was $118.90 [so $17.90 in taxes]. The 2nd room had a $30 self-park charge attached to it (would have been nice for them to tell me that is how much self-parking costs...yikes!). So, $101 + $30 = $151.78 [yeah, they also charged me $2.78 in ""self-parking taxes"" meaning that parking really cost $32.78]. That seems really steep for a parking garage that is not secured in any way, is full of creepy people who are sleeping in the garage (saw a guy passed out in the back of a jeep--hope that was his car), and then requires a bunch of weird stairways to get from the garage into the hotel [again, doesn't ADA ever get enforced in Nashville?]. 

So, don't ever stay in this dump of a hotel. How this place has survived without getting shut down for poor maintenance, the grime, or the lack of ADA compliance is beyond me!",2021-08-29 16:40:36 UTC,1,1,0,1,t7yugklQdU5adf0KJImpGA

Very friendly and helpful and knows how to keep the party jumping.  They have a private parking lot for you to park and restroom facilities at the start point as well. We were celebrating a friends birthday and the experience was awesome.

You have to remember a few things. First, you have to bring your own drinks, preferably in a cooler with ice. Second, someone has to sit in the center and serve as a bar tender. Someone will also have to serve as DJ. The music is booming.  We took the easy route and went with Amazon music. Also, don't forget to bring some cash to tip your guide.  The bike can get hot and sunny at times so you may need some sunscreen and dress accordingly. 

Peddling is more of a time filler and not what gets the bike to move. The bike has a small motor and will get you where you are going without any issues. So, you do not have to pedal. There are a few stops at some bars along the way.  We stopped at the Patron Saint and St. Joseph's. The experience lasted about an hour and a half and was a great time by all. 

The Dugout bar across the street from the loading point will not serve people coming off of the Pickled Pedaler. They say it has something to do with an accident they had with a pedaler.

I highly recommend doing this at least once. It is a great time and it is in walking distance of many downtown bars and restaurants so you can easily pre-game and/or keep the party going depending on how you roll.",2021-08-28 19:51:28 UTC,5,1,0,1,5mfTAVWU1iPUuG_Otm8enw

Are you seriously being condescending to me for placing my child in her pack and play while I grab the rest of my bags RIGHT OUTSIDE OF THE DOOR? Gross. Claiming something as 'state of the art' doesn't in fact make it such (In fact its quite laughable when you visit the property.)

Your lack of knowledge about your water supply is even more disturbing. However, I don't buy your ignorance. I did my research on your water supply after we left, now I know why you supply a few water bottles for customers....certainly not because you know your water is garbage, right???

I was quite excited to stay here as I haven't been back to Tucson for over 35 years. Our check-in was a positive experience. The gentleman at the front desk was personable and tried his best to be helpful. Unfortunately he wasn't well informed about what was open and when on the property. He did recommend and checked us into a recently renovated west facing room which was nice.

We drove over to the building and parked. The first thing we could see were dishes laying all over. Wedged in succulents outside housekeeping, in the planters outside rooms, it was odd for a place that bills itself as a ""grand resort.""

The most DISGUSTING thing we were greeted with as we unloaded our car was a USED TAMPON APPLICATOR and other trash in the planter. During the three days and two nights we were at the property none of this trash was ever picked up (pics of the mess posted).
We went to the lounge to have a drink and some dinner on our first night. There was a loud and obnoxious group who had obviously been overserved at the bar. They were swearing and carrying on in a very uncouth manner, it felt more like a dive bar than a resort lounge. It turned out one of their party worked or used to work at the resort. She would just walk behind the bar and pour herself and her party drinks and the bartender didn't seem to take any issue with it. After watching this for about 10 minutes the bartender finally came over to take our order. Ordered the burger and asked if I could add bacon and was told it would be an extra $7. I'm not a cheapskate but I also don't like to be taken advantage of so I passed.

The next day we tried to schedule a couples massage but it turned out they were short staffed. As a compromise we opted to do one right after the other. Unfortunately the spa was more interested in packing their bookings than providing resort level service. The therapist was too tired during our massages and had to keep stopping to shake the cramps out of her arms. At one point she started a deep massage on one leg and couldn't finish the other leg because of issues with her bicep.

The next morning we went to the restaurant to have breakfast. It took 20 minutes before anyone even acknowledged we were waiting. Another couple that came after us ended up going to get the front desk to find someone to help! Then it took another 10 minutes to get a table cleared off and seat us. When we sat down the couple at the table next to us informed us they'd been waiting 45 minutes, got one mimosa and no one had even been back to take their order. We took that as our queue to leave and have breakfast in town. The other couple followed our lead.

This property is a far cry from anything remotely resembling a ""grand resort."" Wyndham should seriously consider reclassifying it. During our trip we stayed at a Wyndham Destination in Phoenix and our experience was 180 degrees different. Would I stay at this Wyndham resort again no. Would I recommend it, definitely no.",2021-06-30 00:34:01 UTC,1,0,1,4,AJw7HU3dhGNpjLfvxUNK7w

The pool was also relatively clean.

Let's iron out a few things though:
The sprinkler plate was not intact in our room. The window had been left open from the previous occupant. Took us over an hour to get bedding and pillows after arriving around 10 pm (we called to let them know our arrival time, too.)

They received a health dept citation in early 2020 for not having hand soap in the women's restroom at the pool. Their solution?  Bar soap. You can't even clean that between patrons and sharing bar soap in a pandemic for COVID-19 (and even not during a pandemic) is completely disgusting. It's a Hilton property. Why can't they afford to install a soap dispenser? We had to request new washcloths every day and they didn't provide lotion or dish soap to use at the counter. I am a Gold member and each room I have stayed in with a kitchen at least provides soap. The back door was jarred shut and wouldn't open half the time, a broken outlet in the 2nd floor hall is extremely dangerous for little ones in the hall and the electrical wires in our room were crossed so that when you turned the bathroom lights on/off it made the kitchen lights flicker. I couldn't believe that they allow pets there. When we used the laundry facility, a guest washed their nasty pet bed in the washer and dryer and we had to use them right afterward. I itched and sneezed the entire rest of my stay. There were rarely ever any towels in the bin at the pool.",2021-04-03 21:21:26 UTC,2,0,0,0,eslGuD1K5NNaiZ5oFoQ0KQ

We were walking down the street when we heard gunshots. Naturally, everyone on the street started running as fast as they could to try to find safety. My friends and I ran into the Four Points by Sheraton - it was the closest building and we were looking for safety to hope avoid getting shot. After entering the building we attempted to catch our breath and began making calls because we realized that someone from our group was missing - and we were terrified that she was hurt. A few moments go by and a security guard walks up to us and asks us if we were guests staying at the hotel. I told him that we were not. He then asked us to leave the building if we are not guests at the hotel. I explained to him that we were just outside where we heard gunshots and people started running as quickly as they could to safety - and that this building was the closest to us. I asked him if we could stay for a few minutes until we could get in touch with our friend and find a safe spot to meet up with her so we could Uber home. The security guard stated ""Yeah, well...welcome to Burbon Street get over it."" Another woman came up to the security guard and I and stated that he had just had the same conversation with her and her friend. They began verbally arguing and we ultimately left when he threatened to have us physically escorted out.

I understand that hotels have rules and that under most situations, people that are not hotel guests should not be inside of the hotel. However, this was a life threatening situation and the complete and utter disregard for the basic human need of safety is absolutely foul.

She had never been before, and I had only ever previously been to the late night swim which I liked. Entering during the day is entirely different than what I experienced at the late night swim. Upon walking in, I approached the desk that I had made payment for entry at the previous time. I was told to make payment with the bartender. So I walk to the bartender (there was only one bartender for a full bar of patrons) and ask to pay. It takes approximately 20 minutes for her to finally get to us so I can pay and order a drink. Two pina coladas cost 28$ before tip, and the admission was 20$ a person... yikes. The cost was strike one. We make our way into the venue and find seating but notice there is absolutely no shade, but you can rent an umbrella for 40$. I'm assuming the venue not having shade was a well-thought-out business tactic, so that really rubbed me the wrong way as well. We decided to visit the bar in the 21+ section as it looked less busy. The bartender was less than enthused to be there and was really brief and uninterested in the patrons that were waiting at the bar as he was prioritizing the bottle service cabanas. Makes sense, but at least make an attempt to acknowledge that there are five people standing at the bar waiting to speak with you. We ordered our drinks and a pizza while up there. The bartender forgot our pizza. About an hour and fifteen minutes had passed before my girlfriend and I flagged someone down to ask where the 30$ pizza was. When we finally got it, it was cold. During us sitting there eating the cold pizza, another patron to our left began vomiting profusely. She continued to do so for about 15-20 minutes. Multiple staff members saw her, clearly in need of an escort to the restroom or a wheelchair to her room and none of them did a thing. My girlfriend and I had to get up, get her water, tend to her, and remind the lifeguards that she had been throwing up all over the floor and chairs for about 20 minutes. The lifeguard rolled her eyes and scoffed before walking away to notify someone. All in all, for a 100+ bill, we got cold pizza, we go to take care of an extremely drunk patron because the staff wouldn't, we got expensive drinks that frankly weren't that good, and a sunburn.

My partner and I have done about 20 escape rooms.  He agreed that this place is the most unique one we have ever been to!

We did ""Mardi Gras"" and ""Inventor's Attic.""

We brought my Dad, who has never done an escape room before, and this was a great experience for him.  He had a good time and the puzzles were not over the top to the point that he had no idea what was going on.  Very family friendly but challenging in a fun way. 

UNIQUE and not ""commercial.""  You can tell this business takes pride in their work.  Many of the puzzles I have not seen done in any other escape room and much of what you see is ""homemade"" which I LOVE!!!

From start to finish, you are immersed in this experience.  I had so much fun.  This was the highlight of our trip to New Orleans (we have been coming every year for over 15 years, sometimes multiple times a year for special events) and I love supporting the local business. 

The creativity and passion of the owners and game masters blew me away; but, I would expect nothing less in New Orleans.   

We will certainly be doing the remaining 2 rooms during our next visit to New Orleans. 

Highly recommend!

HEALTH & SAFETY
The attention to safety and health was also very much appreciated during this challenging time for everyone.  The game master gently reminded my Dad to lift his mask up and he happily complied.  I was happy they did that, because I remind him too!  

The rooms are also private bookings at the time of this review, which is awesome!

PARKING & LOCATION
We found easy paid street parking about a half a block away from the business.  Very easy to find, clearly marked entrance, and in a quiet part of the Central Business District (aka ""downtown"") not too far from the French Quarter.

Gone are the cobwebs and mold that once made a stay here feel like an Airbnb flop at the nearby Betsy Ross House. The rooms are pure minimalist modern, so pack lightly as storage space and drawers for your clothing are at a premium. All I know is that it suits my preferences in style and attitude. 

I'm dropping one star for an in-room HVAC unit that sounded like it was sourced from Boeing and the impossibly inscrutable light switches that took an advanced degree in industrial design from MIT to first locate, and then operate. I felt like the perplexed ape around the monolith in Kubrick's 2001 trying to dim the mood lighting around the headboard.

On the plus side, this place is very un-Marriot and that's a good thing. No offense to Betsy Ross. A solid four stars.

I got an email this month that advertised a $10.00 entry fee for every Wednesday of the month (June) after 3:00pm, so I went. When I arrived I was told that it was changed by their 'Entertainmet Manager' and it would be $20.00 every day.
Well, at this point,  after 3:00pm, it just wasn't worth paying $20.00. So, I left.  They would have gotten their money from me as I was planning to eat and drink plenty.

I guessed that it was woefully understaffed and confirmed my suspicions by finding about 30 jobs posted online for this location. The employees that we encountered were polite and professional and that's the only reason I can give this review even 3 stars. 

While our room was clean upon arrival, there was no housekeeping service during our stay and didn't happen even upon request. However, I ran into a housekeeper in the hallway and she kindly exchanged our towels. Otherwise, the hotel needs a deep cleaning inside and out - and I mean all the way out to the street. We were dodging smashed gummy bears and ""celebratory whatnot"" while walking into the hotel and the one elevator that was temporarily working stank of spilled beer in the corner. I would guess Heineken by the odor. 

Now about that temporarily working elevator. I walked through the lobby on Saturday afternoon and was alerted by the desk clerk to use ""additional elevators"" due to a malfunction of both lobby units, one of which did not work for the duration of our stay. After following the signs through the dining room, then the kitchen, then a back door to where in the heck I had no idea I was going, I was greeted by a security guard at the service elevator doors. The guard kindly explained that once I arrived on our floor, I should go through the wood door after exiting the elevator. He warned me not to use any other doors, else I would find myself so lost and alone that I would end up talking to a ball named Wilson! Fortunately, I used the correct door and was reunited with my family without incident.

We enjoyed a good breakfast in the dining room each morning, but I was sad to see overworked and undermanaged staff doing their best to serve guests. These folks were clearly working hard, but were not adequately trained as table servers and I observed several instances of guests acting rudely toward them as a result. While we will never rid the world of boorish behavior, the problem in general may be solved through better management.

Good location. Initial impression is good when you walk in. Had beer tubs next to check in desk. Staff was friendly for the 5 minutes I interacted with them. 

Had a balcony room - you share the balcony with the room next to you. No biggie. 

Coffee maker didn't work. Bed sheets had stains on them, had to call to get new ones, that they plopped inside our door. 
Room was a bit run down, and def could use some upgrading

We were there from Tuesday - Saturday, (for New Year's Eve) they don't clean rooms unless you ask assuming due to COVID. 

Nothing special or really nice about the room. Probably wouldn't stay here again. 

Shower took forever to get hot. Pressure wasn't good at all. 

Biggest complaint is there are NO garbage cans anywhere around the lobby to throw anything out. 

If you get food and bring back to the room you have to leave the trash in the hallway outside your door, which I find disgusting. Garbage cans in room are TINY and there aren't any in the lobby - weird???? Not by the elevators, nothing? Hand Sanitizing stations yes garbage cans, no. Couldn't even fit something bigger than a hand wipe in the garbage in the lobby bathroom. So very odd.

The lady who checked us in and was running the front desk most of the time (including during the parade) was very welcoming and helpful.  The rooms were nice and we had a room that overlooked the fire station and the Irish bar.  As well as an apartment with funny Halloween decorations.  Our friend had a room with a balcony over the pool and some friendly guests across the way that used theirs a lot and we enjoyed chatting with them.  We could have seen the parade from her balcony but chose to go down to the street.  The pool was nice and chill and the very friendly restocking the towels let us know that we could use the pool also at their sister hotel but we never made it over there.  But it was a chill place for midday but don't expect any food or drinks because their restaurant is non-existant.

The Cons -

- There is no continental breakfast (they say because of Covid)
- There is no room service because of Covid but they said to just call if we needed it and/or needed anything
- The one morning we did need our coffee and tea pods replenished and we called them to ask for more, the lady was not helpful at all and told us to come down to the lobby to get it.  Sorry, but I'm in my pajamas which is why I was asking for someone to bring us some.  Not going down to the lobby in my pj shorts and tank!!
- Beware - there really was no restaurant.  Sure, they have a sign at all the elevators that make the food look delicious but is never open (4 pm - 10 pm) and even then they wouldn't seat us and they weren't doing room service.  This is no fault of the hotel because it's obviously run separately but should not appear to be the hotel restaurant because it's not and does nothing for the hotel guests (separate review coming for them)

Also the hotel is walking distance to the french quarter and the hotel.  Overall, I would stay here again but maybe once they have room service and continental breakfast back",2021-11-04 16:03:29 UTC,4,2,0,3,viDTQ86CSNWH8VQKrJQVlg

Bad lighting in the room with old flourescent bulbs that no one uses anymore! This hotel needs updating badly!

They don't have parking on site so it costs $45-$60 daily for valet or you can find a surrounding parking lot. You will be public parking for over $25. 

The room was subpar. I think they made up the bed without changing a sheet cause the bathroom was disgusting. Oh, don't use the restroom at night because it will stay running an extra 30 seconds after flushing it.... The comforter had someone else's hair on it and the chair in the room...no comment. I didn't book this hotel, but I am grateful for a night to lay my head to head back to my own clean bathroom/bedroom. 

I know New Orleans has been through a lot and staffing is probably short, but come now. You have to do better.

We only stayed for one night so I could pick up our niece and drive back to Atlanta so needless to say...I didn't waste my time nor their time complaining. It would've been nice to have a clean room.

ANYWAY...

I chose this hotel FOR A REASON.. I am disabled, on chemo and having memory issues... not only that but I was there to mourn my mother!!! 
It took me time to plan this hotel, get the route down and feel comfortable with itinerary!!! When you are SICK you have to take more measures than a person who IS NOT SICK! 
I called 5 days BEFORE I was due to stay there and verified my room with two Queen beds and was told everything is set! 
The day before I got an odd voicemail asking me if I still wanted my room with two Queen beds and if not to call them and tell tell them. I thought this was odd so I called back. I verified that I wanted my room with two Queen beds and they said ok and confirmed it. 
The following day I called them because something just told me something was amiss.... I asked if my room was ready and they said YES! I also informed them that I would be checking in a little late and told the woman 11 pm on the phone!!!! She said great you are all set, room is ready! 
We were excited because it had been a very long and emotional day and we were exhausted and looking forward to a NICE ROOM in a ""nice hotel"" 
We arrived at around 11 pm, just a smidge after and the guy said I'm sorry we have no rooms!!!!  
THIS IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE!!!  
He said they are sending us elsewhere on them and I was PISSED OFF! I had to tell him this wasn't right! I was ready to crash at that moment! 
Well we got lost and finally found the new place RIGHT AT THE AIRPORT!!! I SPECIFICALLY DID NOT WANT THE AIRPORT!! Now I have to figure out our leave for the airport plan ALL OVER! 
Had to go up two escalators to get to lobby to check in. Guy at the desk was a JERK! Instead of apologizing and trying to make an obviously upset person feel better he was a JERK! Like it's my fault YOUR COMPANY MESSED UP! I am disabled and distraught already and you talk to me like that!!!!???? SERIOUSLY and if your reading I did catch your snappy rude tone of voice! I was just trying to be as nice as I possibly could so I didn't get hysterical crying!!!  
So get this... he didn't want to, it seemed to inconvenience him but he helped us with a cart and our belongings since I can't lift or move very well. Then we walk into our room.... WOW one king bed and I didn't even have a bath tub ( I need to soak to get my bones working, yes I bring my own cleaner) I was so exhausted I couldn't even cry. We got settled after midnight so we could get up and out by 5am. My husband slept on the floor (couch was too small) because I had back surgery and have to lay in bed a certain way so I don't do any more damage to it... that was nice for him..... I WANTED TWO QUEEN BEDS FOR A REASON!!!!! 
It would have been nice if the jerk at the front desk had offered a sincere apology and tried to make better a bad situation but he didn't!!!! They should have at least offered a stay for one night on them our next trip... something MORE than just here go to this hotel instead and we will pay your one night. Oh I also didn't get my BonVoy points!!! 
Now corporate doesn't care about one little customer like me that's obvious. One customer being totally thrown in the garbage isn't a big deal which is a shame. Thank you so much for taking an already bad situation for us and making it even more miserable. 
This is really bad business and bad customer service.

*sigh* I try to be understanding, especially in this Covid age but oofa! Fair warning this one is gonna be a bit on the long side, so the TLDR: not worth the money. Ok, let's start with the positives

The Good: I'm leading off with the best person in the building. David the breakfast attendant was all I could ask for. His level of hospitality was right up there with any I've ever experienced. Seriously, he could teach lessons (to some of the people on staff). The hotel bartender was also very warm and welcoming, the valet guys always greeted us but then again I didn't have to drop $30/night because I didn't drive. The location is also a plus.......sort of. You're centrally located and on the outskirts of the ""middle"" of downtown but just a heads up there's a homeless PROBLEM!!!!

The bad: This place needs security in the worse way!!!! We had THREE run-ins with homeless people in the hotel, including the instant we walked in. Mid check in a homeless guy comes up to us in the lobby and starts asking us to call 911 because he's having a heart attack. Come to find out that he does this on a regular basis! My favorite part of the ordeal was the the guy checking us in is looking at us for help. ""Sir we don't live here, I'm pretty sure this falls under your jurisdiction"". The second interaction came as we returned late one night, we were on the 6th floor where there's a conference room. A guy was up there using the men's room, I thought he was just a guest but then the light bulb went on, I asked if the toilet in his room was clogged and he just made a bee line for the elevators. The third was coming out of out room and seeing a kid just sitting outside our door. After looking left and right for his parents I asked if he was ok, and he walked to the elevators too....WTF.

Another notch in the bad category is the smell. The lobby and especially STINK to high heaven. I don't know if its a sewer issue but we were there for six days and it never went away. I would've complained about it but, bad notch #3

THERE'S NEVER ANYONE AT THE FRONT DESK!!!!!!! Seriously, every time I needed something I had to have a Marco Polo like scavenger hunt. I'm not unreasonable, I understand that people want to sit down and be on their phone (seriously every employee that came out of the back room after I bellowed had their cellphone in their hands) how about pulling up a chair and hiding the phone under the counter where the customer can't see? 

The final bad was a personal one (hopefully it won't happen to you). I booked through a third party site so to reserve the room I used my ""internet credit card"" I keep a card with just enough money to pay for streaming service because I have prescription grade trust issues. When I checked in (after the guy doing his Fred Sanford impersonation) I told the guy checking in that I wanted to put the room on my ""real"" credit card, he told me not to worry about it until I check out, cool I thought.... the day before I check out I'm getting alerts for overdraft. I check and see that they're trying to put the hotel on the internet card. After going to the front desk (real credit card in hand) I'm told again that it was a mistake and not to worry about it until check out. The next night while out at dinner they tried to charge my internet card SIX FRAKKING TIMES!!!!! It happened so often that my bank called me thinking it was a fraud charge or that my card was stolen. I went back with a righteous fury and was told that no one had mentioned this to the Saturday person. My god people get your communication together!!!

Now for the strange: For whatever reason, at least on the sixth floor, there's extension cords everywhere that just dead end behind random doors. I'm not sure what's behind those doors but I'm guessing a TARDIS!!!!

I seriously thought about asking for my money back after the credit card fiasco but I just decided to not stay at the chain anymore.",2021-01-08 06:06:57 UTC,2,0,0,1,2K7-oRoXUfHfCIPGwclT6g

It looked bad and old and neglected. At least the towels, bedsheets, and bathtub looked clean, I'll give them one star for that
2. No coffee maker in the room as mentioned on their website :( when asked about it the front desk guy said that every room should have one but sometimes a guest will break it....okay so I guess they don't replace it? 
3. The outlets did not look safe...they were falling out of the wall...
4. Um we didn't have a trash can in our room, luckily we had our own grocery shopping plastic bag to use for trash so we had that going for us 
5. The shower was terrible!!! I had the hot water up all the way and it only went to lukewarm, then in the middle of my shower the water turned freezing cold. Other reviews mentioned problems with the hot water, so I can confirm. 

I can probably mention more but these were the biggest problems.

Edit: I got a reply back to this review (see below). To take these problems into consideration y'all need a MAJOR OVERHAUL. Complete renovation from the ground up. New floors, paint, hot water heater, furniture...so please everyone else looking at this review, I don't think much will be changed, but maybe they'll add trash cans and a coffee maker (as advertised)",2021-06-01 02:23:42 UTC,1,0,0,1,GibK-a-ObpNyP_5EWLi3Ig

It's dirty..smells and is run down. We shouldn't of even stayed one night how bad it was but we spent so much on the hotel we tried our best to wait it out.. first and foremost they gave us a room that our ONLY window was directly on someone else's balcony(see pictures) so we couldn't even open our windows. It was poorly light by a few lamps..the hallways were dirty ...the lobby looked like you walked into a 1990s hotel and the paint was chipped. Upon checking the sheets we found out that 3 of our 4 pillows on the bed were stained...the sheet was stained and the comforter was stained. We then inspected our linens to realize more then 75% of them were dirty as well. We called down and requested new towels..our new towels were again stained. I called the front desk and told them that our sheets and pillows were dirty..their response was "" we only provide house keeping every 3rd day and since it isn't your third day you will have to come down to us in the lobby and pick up sheets"" I tried to call them and ask them for the sheet change discreetly so not everyone there knew how much of a s!*t hole it was. But with that response I knew I had to stand my ground..I go to the front desk and spoke with Nancy as well as the other younger gentlemen and again told them these sheets were dirty from the people prior to us and not us ...Nancy then told me that she will get us fresh linens for us to then go back upstairs and make our own bed ..like whhhhaaatt??? That's what I'm paying to stay at a hotel for! I told her we were going out for the night and won't be back til much later so there was no rush to do it right this second and she said she'll call down the Housekeep supervisor. How this guy is a ""supervisor"" is beyond me. He lacks all customer service skills. He told us to ""stop yelling at him"" when me while all we were doing was discussing it with him. He then told us ""he was going to change our sheets"" but mind you the front desk told us we needed to do it . So the communication skills lack. After MUCH reluctance he went to our room to do our sheets. We had to come up while he was doing it because we forgot jackets. I thanked him for doing it and he went ""mm"" and I said goodbye have a nice night & he ignored me. So somehow we got attitude because dirty place gave us  dirty linens every time we asked for a refresh. The only thing nice about this place was it's location to the beach otherwise your better off sleeping on the street. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy.

We pull up and have an easy time checking in, which is always nice. 
We walk up to our door, noting the ""no smoking "" sign as we open the door. Immediately, we are hit with a wall of stale smoke smell as we enter the room (I would like to add that my roommate and I both had to wash all our clothes after the trip, even the ones that stayed in our luggage the whole time, because the smoke smell permeated it all so much). Looking around the room, we notice that mostly all the furniture is on the brink of collapse, the couch has a plethora of questionable fluid stains, and the fan in the bathroom is dangling from the ceiling. Heading to bed, we turn off the lights to find that the lights do not actually turn off all the way; the switch will turn them off, but they continued to have a low glow (pictured) the entire night. That was in addition to being able to tell that the door had clearly been kicked in a time or two before, seeing that a beam of light, as well as all the street noise and yelling, from outside readily fluttered into our room from the door (which was present for all 3 nights we were there).

Now, I do have 3 positives:
1) The housekeeping did a wonderful job at providing fresh towels and fresh toiletries each day. 
2) The bed was surprisingly comfortable. 
3) Crazy experiences like these are always more memorable than the good, as-expected ones, so I mustn't fail to mention the laughter that all this provided for the trip. 

Overall, I would definitively not recommend staying here, regardless of any possible savings or perceived convenience. But hey, sometimes, you just have to laugh and let the experience be a warning for others. :)",2021-07-14 19:03:16 UTC,1,0,0,1,KEk3HFQWk838one1kbmjvA

One pro tip.  If you are standing up and getting on or off the plane and no one is in front of you, you are the cork.  Saying that last bit of conversation or somehow not remembering your luggage overhead really is not an excuse.

Do they have flight cancelled?  Yes.  Are their flights late? yes.  But whenever these two things happen Southwest has done everything in its power not   to let it happen.  I have had flight cancelled do to plane problems well not cancelled they rolled up another plane we switched gates and went to destination.  Late yes I have had late flights they try to get it back on schedule as it has a domino effect on the rest of the planes connections.  I again have seen Southwest change planes and get you there on time.  

When you are finished with all the stupid add ons with other Airlines Southwest will come out within a few bucks of the cheapo air.  And you have the confidence they will try and get you to your destination.

I have one funny story there was some college age girls flying to Naples.  I don't know how they decided the pilot tried to land in Miami but they did.  Now for the rest of their lives they will tell everyone how Southwest tried to land in MIami and not Naples. :)",2021-07-24 17:19:13 UTC,5,12,5,12,Z8eHygED8VUsXfwy7c3kkA

The last time I was here, this hotel was fantastic and it proved the same even after all of the time had passed. That already says so much about how nice this hotel is! The place  is clean, the facilities are okay, and the night sleep is good.

First, the cleanliness. There is not one issue here. The bathroom was spotless and the beds were great. I stayed here for two nights. So, for the housekeeping, one of my family members requested just towels for when they came around and not a full out cleaning. What did they end up doing? Cleaning the whole room, making beds, the whole gig. That is fantastic!
My Rating for this Category: 5/5

Next up, the facilities. I did not explore this category enough, but I do know that there is no pool at this location. I am not sure if there is a fitness center. On the other hand, this is a Courtyard so they have a cool bistro/restaurant place and that adds such a vibe to this hotel.
My Rating for this Category: 4/5

Finally is the night sleep. My night sleep was good. The pillow was supportive, the sheets were fine, and as previously stated, the bed was clean. My whole family did get really hot during the night at about 68F, but that's our fault for having the temperature up. I'd recommend setting the temperature to 65-66F. It may look cold, but it isn't.
My Rating for this Category: 5/5

Besides that, there wasn't strong enforcement to be sure guests keep their masks on in the common areas. Room was nice and clean, walls were thin but wasn't a problem besides our dog getting startled when folks walked by.

We started the night off with the madori sour and jalapeño prickly pear margarita. The drinks were excellent as usual. It was so good that we had seconds and then thirds! We then proceed to try out the starters, which was the roasted Brussels sprouts. Let me tell you, It was spectacular! With every bite I could taste the honey that compliments the Brussels sprouts. I recommend trying it next time you eat here. 

For the entree, I went with the 12oz ribeye steak that comes with the leek-potato au gratin and roasted garlic asparagus. I enjoyed the steak with the asparagus but wasn't a fan of the au gratin. My wife got her usual which was the scallops. There was no complaints there, it was made perfectly. For dessert we went with the creme brûlée and pretty much called it a night. 

We eat here pretty frequently and enjoyed the food here very much. This time around we thought that the choices on the menu was not that many to choose from. We were told by the waitress that the food was by seasons and I thought this season fell short on expectations.

Condor Express is truly one of the best whale watching companies in Santa Barbara. They do their research on where to find the whales and we saw about 4-5 whales on our trip. However, I did get a little seasick. The ride was around 2 hours long and they did have food available. Since I'm not really that big of a fan of boats, I took a little nap because I felt super dizzy and seasick. I still enjoyed the trip and I'm glad my boyfriend had a great time.

After a month and a half, I made several attempts to communicate with the woman I first booked the rooms with, through emails, phone calls and voicemails, to see how many were reserved. She never responded. Once we had the rooms reserved, a family member tried to book a room and it took her 45 mins. to do so. Another family member tried to reserve a room and was told they were already all booked. (I had 15 rooms put aside at the time and by speaking to family members, knew there were still rooms available). I finally got someone on the phone a day before the cut off date,  (which was a Saturday), and was told I couldn't talk to the 'sales rep' until Monday which was when I found out the woman was no longer working there but no one bothered to follow up and let me know. Longer story short, I explained how it was unfair that no one relayed this information to me and that some family members still needed rooms. (Albeit they waited until the last minute). :(
Which to me, wasn't the point at the time and their unprofessionalism was. After I had a very frustrating phone conversation with someone who quickly passed the blame to me, my husband decided to make a call to the  corporate offices in Chicago and talk to a 'higher' person there and they directed him right back to the Carmel location. After he had another frustrating phone call with incompetent staff, they basically called me a liar, accused him of being racist, (totally untrue!!) and said his profanity was unacceptable! (Can't blame him there in light of things). They in turn, sent me an email cancelling all of our rooms. I would give them a minus score if I could!! Would love to start a lawsuit, but probably not worth the time and frustration. (Apparently there are plenty of other terrible reviews when it comes to this hotels' sales department!) Our out-of-town guests ended up booking rooms elsewhere with no problem at all.

But that was then and this is now. Located in the Hyatt Place hotel in downtown Tampa, is Corazon restaurant- the definition of a relaxed vibe with a sophisticated soul. 

After a hectic and early Friday wedding ceremony, food was excellent when we had the chance to sit down and catch our breath a bit. Think Latin-themed menu filled with seafood, some plantains, green salad with Avocado, etc (with non-Latin foods as well). The bar is large, there's enough seating available and the style is banging too. 

Our server was wonderful, upbeat and boy... did my girl know the menu left and right because she didn't even write anything down. So much so, there was a curveball where my sister in law asked our server if the kitchen can whip up a plain personal pizza for her 12 yr old grandson and it was a ""yes"". 

My Truffle Fries were delicious. You know how you order ""Truffle Fries"" from some places and taste nothing like it? Not here. They were DELICIOUS. My only regret was not taking a second basket up to my hotel room! My Grouper Bites appetizer could've been a main meal- I kid you not.

First, if you are staying for multiple nights you have to ASK for your room to be cleaned or you don't even get your towels refreshed. And even when I did request fresh towels, the front desk clerk was overwhelmed by other guests checking in and it took a while to get fresh towels.

Had to leave the house and get a hotel really close by. We booked 3 rooms through #hotwire .  When we (me, my sister, my 2 nieces, and 4 children) arrived my sister recieved her 2 rooms. I'm in line behind her and the lady at the front desk said we don't have any more rooms. I said I made my reservation the same time as my sister. She told me hold on, asked for my name and said ""Ok, here you go"". I finally recieved my keys around midnight. We all go up to our rooms to get settled. After about a half hour, my daughter said ""Mom, that's a roach!"" It was alive and crawling. We sprayed it. After a few more minutes, another one, then another one. At this time, it's late, they have no more rooms, and the little one's were settled in bed. We couldn't go back to the house, or separate due to other obligations. We stayed up all night. They were crawling on our headboard, dressers, walls, everything. Early the next morning I headed out to handle the situation at the house. I called the Hotel and explained to them that their room (225) was infested with roaches and the guy (Chris) explained they had a no refund policy.  He was very rude and told me to call hotwire. I did, and when hotwire called them they denied my refund. THE NAME OF THE HOTEL IS #americasbesthotel in Pottstown, Pennsylvania.",2021-11-08 16:14:00 UTC,1,0,0,0,DYFumEExbGZsWlDd5SgtVg

Sean handled the reservation and was willing to do as much or as  little planning as we wanted.  Since we weren't as familiar to wineries  in the Solvang area, we asked Sean to make some recommendations and we  would go from there.  Sean asked what we liked and made some suggestions  and then the reservations for us.  As we talked to friends who are more  familiar with Santa Ynez area, they suggested wineries that Sean had  already booked for us (We took this as a good sign)  Sean booked 4  wineries for us with tasting between 60 - 90 minutes.

We were then introduced via email to our driver Richard who was  great.  A couple days ahead of the trip, he asked us about lunch plans  and provided a couple suggestions and offered to pick it up for us  between the first and second tasting so we could have with the second  tasting at Grassini by the pond.  We took his suggestion and selected  Lucky Hen Larder for lunch and the Antipasto and Turkey sandwiches were  fantastic.

Richard arrived exactly on time and was the start of a great day.  As  we proceeded with the tastings, we were a little ahead of schedule so  discussed adding a 5th winery.   It meant adjusting the reservations at  the other wineries but while we were tasting at the third vineyard,  Richard was working the phones and contacted the 5th winery to make sure  they could accommodate us and adjusted our reservation for the 4th  tasting.  When all was taken care of, he simply texted me to confirm.   Fantastic service - keep it up.

We will definitely use Destination Drivers again.  We had complete  control over our schedule and could add in a 5th winery with no real  effort (Thanks again Richard).  We liked all the wineries that Sean  suggested.  Richard was a very safe driver.  Richard dropped us off at  the entrance to each winery and as soon as he saw us come out the door,  he would bring the car up to us.  Our car was left in the exact same  condition as when we started.",2021-09-27 04:36:27 UTC,5,1,0,2,mfMUDoGFrCIjOFctL3hRew

There is a vodka distillery in Bethalto. Who would have thought it? I wouldn't, I was totally surprised and I am glad my Yelp friend, Tina S. introduced me to this hidden delight. 

When I say, hidden I do mean hidden. If I had not seen the sign by the road, I would have driven past it. Even when I pulled into the parking lot, I was saying to myself, this cannot be right. Then I saw the door simply labeled, Bluestem. 

Once you are beyond the door, you are in a minimalist style bar with a friendly bartender. I hope you like vodka, because that is what they sell and it's what they offer. They're working on a ""Gin"" so hopefully they'll be offering that in the near future. 

Just offering vodka is fine with me, because Dirty Martinis has recently been my go to cocktail. I was pleasantly surprised how smooth and silky the Bluestem vodka was. In fact it was so smooth, I enjoyed more than one Dirty. I was also surprised, I had no headache the next morning. Typically, when I drink an affordable vodka over a premium vodka, I may have a headache the next morning. So, I guess I can say Bluestem's quality is in the premium class. 

If you need something to nosh on while sipping and drinking the vodka, they offer a variety of frozen pizzas. If that is not your thing, the restaurant near by will make deliveries to the distillery. 

I had so much fun, I have joined the group that meets here once a month for Happy Hour.

My Mom and I took the tour yesterday, and we both loved it! Clayton, our tour guide, was a wealth of non-stop knowledge about Philly's rich musical history. The tour starts at the Wyndham Hotel in Old City. The 3 hour charter bus tour (there is a bathroom on the bus) takes you from South Philly to North Philly as you learn about the history of the Philadelphia music scene from jazz to gospel, classical to hip-hop.

My Mom is a retired music teacher, and I am a music teacher for the city school district, and both of us walked away from the tour with so much newfound knowledge. As long as you love music, you will love this tour! During the tour, as Clayton was speaking, he also shared video clips of the different musicians. There were also 3 stops along the way where we got to get off the bus and look around, so that was a good chance to stretch our legs.

This is such a unique tour, and I definitely recommend it when visiting Philly!",2021-07-26 00:22:54 UTC,5,0,0,0,GfPztA91zVMWAugNdWyn2w

It is located on the over walkway approaching the pier head. It is the only marine environmental education center in downtown St. Pete. 

The center is presented by the Milkey Family Foundation and run by Tampa Bay Watch, a non profit founded in 1993. Their mission is to protect and restore the Tampa Bay estuary through scientific research and educational outreach programs. They perform habitat restoration throughout the year and participate in protection measures. They rely heavily on community volunteers. The center was created to teach people about the Tampa Bay ecosystem and what we can all do to protect it. 

The Discovery Center is composed of a small indoor exhibit gallery and an classroom and an outdoor wet classroom that is used by field trips. There are a few interactive displays, video presentations, marine tanks, and a touch tank. There is also a small gift shop. 

I really loved the seahorse tank. They were being fed during our visit. I also got to get up close with a starfish and sea urchin in the touch tank. Another display I liked was about the oyster beds that are used to clean the water in the bay. I was already familiar with this because oyster beds were also used to clean the Lake Worth Lagoon, a body of water in Lake Worth Florida. A large wave display is made of plastic water bottles which do not break down. It drives home why we all should be using reusable water bottles. 

All of the displays are designed to bring awareness on how everyone can be better stewards of the environment. You can take a self guided tour or one led by a docent. Admission is $5 and it is considered a donation to Tampa Bay Watch. Tampa Bay Watch members get unlimited entry to the discovery center. 

I am glad I stopped by and was interesting learning about the great work being done by the Tampa Bay Watch. As I stepped out of the center I caught sight of dolphins swimming off the pier which was a thrill. It is nice to know that there is a great local organization keeping their home safe for them. Adding a marine educational center to the pier was a great idea.",2021-02-24 20:53:36 UTC,4,78,23,82,Sp5av2eeRWC1Z2bzwRw_Yw

I've seen this business respond to negative reviews, but ours is how we feel it should be.

We went from a 2020 27ft bump out, to a 2018 30ft single space. Every campground we had booked months in advance was for the 27ft, bump out. Not to mention I had prepared, bought, and was planning around the bump out. We made it work, but we didn't appreciate this happening TWO days before our trip. One of the cargo doors didn't have a lock that actually worked, so we were constantly worried our larger items that had to remain down there would be stolen when we left the camper. Lastly, the front door was messed up to where we couldn't even open the door. We called, Keith mentioned a couple things to do, one being to call a locksmith. While we're at a truck stop. We had to have our 8 and 12 year old sons climb through the small windows to try and help us out. Would we have had the issues we did if we had the other camper? Perhaps, but overall we were just not impressed with the camper itself. The staff however always answered the phone, always tried to help us out when needed. They even called us back if they thought they missed our call.

So yesterday I rented out the white GMC Yukon. So upon pick up, I was informed that Enterprise is yet again raising their security deposit amount to $400 PLUS the cost of the rental. Which is just ridiculous. I been using Enterprise for awhile and apparently in January or February of this year, they already raised the security deposit from $200 to $300, and now come Monday it will be $400. This will make it extremely difficult for those less fortunate people that are on a budget but need a rental vehicle to even rent. It's just sad. Next, the staff and I go out to the Yukon to do the walk around, the outside of the truck is extremely dirty, the windshield had a bunch of crap on it, which definitely made it hard for me to see driving during the night, because the windshield cleaner and wipers couldn't clean the crap off, and the trunk also not even vacuumed out it seemed. Anyway, she gets into the Yukon, I guess to check the mileage, plus gas range and lets the driver door swing open! My BRAND NEW, LEASED car was parked right next to it. Not parked over the line or anything. The Yukon door flys opens and hits my car leaving a huge white mark on the passenger side of my vehicle. Now she did get some kinda compound and get most of everything off, but still was left a small white mark, that will bother me for the remainder of my lease, and a small dent also! Finally, now onto the rental of the Yukon. After getting the vehicle and taking off, immediately I noticed the suv shifts so hard. A 2020 suv with under 40,000 shouldn't be shifting like that. Weather its a v6 or v8, a pretty new suv as itself, should shift smooth enough where you barely even know the thing is shifting, but NOPE that was not the case at all. The suv also makes tons of noise while driving along the highway, with its terrible, hard shifting. The suv just wasn't a smooth ride at all. After getting on the turnpike, all these warning lights or reminders come on, about service front camera, something about the forward collision being off, and service tire monitor system. Mind you this is a $200 a day suv, and after the protection comes out to $250.75 a day. The experience I had just wasn't worth it at all. I usually never take a rental car back early because you don't get any money back for the early hours you return and I would have loved to keep it another day, but today I just wanted to get it back to them ASAP, because it obviously wasn't test driven or properly serviced before renting out, which is unfortunate. So I returned the vehicle as soon as I woke up. In my conclusion, I just hope to not have to deal with Enterprise anymore. This location and the Burlington location used to be the best ones in my opinion, but after this terrible rental experience here, and now that the Burlington location seemed to have hired new, young people, that aren't that professional at all, basically leaves me to cut ties with Enterprise all together. Unfortunately the guy I did my return with didn't even ask how my experience was or how the suv even driven.",2021-04-29 16:14:01 UTC,1,0,0,0,Zx_f5Szz7abLKh8TLgco5g

It was actually 1 1/2 hours farther, but when your body is numb after 8 hrs in the saddle, it's the same.
We could see the property from the highway and it looked like an oasis in the desert.  It is a very good looking building that was only two years old.  There was a huge warehouse complex a mile down the road including a Amazon distribution center.  Which explains the ton of construction going on around it.
This is probably one of the nicest Residence Inn's we have stayed at.  There is a large strip mall in front of the hotel, so there is a good selection of food choices within walking distance.
The desk clerk was super friendly and helpful. Her name was Ashley, she is the bomb!
The room (see pics) was roomy and well laid out.  It was neat, clean and modern. Again,  it is only 2 years old.  If Marriott keeps the property up, especially due to its location (just outside Indianapolis) it will continue to be a favorite of mine.

I highly recommend their phenomenal transportation services!!! I will definitely be using them again in the near future!!!!

The place is popular and it's easy to see why. The guests are great. Everyone is nice and honest. A lot of families and older people. I left a sock in the dryer and someone returned it to the laundry room for me to find it. I was waiting for a washer and the guy that was using it came looking for me to tell me it was open. When in our room, we had the door open all the time, and enjoyed the wonderful ocean breeze. 

The people around the pool are chatty, friendly or they keep to themselves. The large hot tub made it easy to distance from other people. The property is on the beach with easy access and an outdoor shower. They have some items you can borrow for the sand too. 

Each room has a reserved parking spot with a few visitor spots available as well. Your must checkin with the office for a pass. There is an elevator but easy enough to use the stairs. 

The room was comfy enough with extra towels under the sink. If you are spoiled, like me, bring your own pillow. We had a problem with the TV remote and the maintenance guy was quick to come try to fix it. It was the remote itself and he didn't know how to reprogram but he tried (We took care of it) when he brought us a new one. 

The laundry is free, but bring your own soap pods. We were nicely stocked with staples in the kitchen with only spending $100 at Trader Joe's (including wine and coffee). The office will give you dish soap, sponge, and some dishwasher tabs. Also coffee filters.

We had a small party here each time and the staff assembled the room to our specifications in advance. It was particularly nice because most hotels have a requirement that you use their own onsite food service but the Residence Inn allows you to use your own catering with no additional fee. The room fee itself is on par with what I've seen for rooms of its size. In pre-COVID times, you could probably put 30-40 people in there comfortably. We had 14 in a U-shape and maintained social distancing between households with no issues.

The rooms themselves are large by any standard. Even the standard rooms have pull-out sofabeds. All have kitchens with full size ovens, refrigerators and dishwashers. Upgrading to a suite separates the bedroom from the family room area which was great for us as we put the kids on the sofabed and were still able to watch TV in the bedroom. And the TV, of course, has my favorite Marriott feature -- Netflix built in. Being new, they also have digital key in the Bonvoy app so you can check in and head straight to your room.

The breakfast is top notch and not scaled back for COVID at all. Each person goes up to the counter and they assemble a to-go order. They have scrambled eggs, biscuits & gravy, waffles, yogurt, fruit, cereal, muffins, etc.

The location is right off of I-65 and is very easy to get into although GPS may misdirect you -- it is behind Kroger so turn in there and just have faith. Getting out can be a little tricky but I recommend cutting through Kroger which will put you at a traffic light to make turning left on Emerson easier.",2021-02-01 04:33:50 UTC,5,2,0,0,JODCm_QYm_9ng2pJSOuhow

When we learned the hotel had been sold and read a few negative reviews, we were very concerned, but decided to give it a try because of the price and location.  We were very pleasantly surprised!  Yes, there have been a few changes, but nothing negative.  The grounds are well maintained and the lobby and hallways were immaculate and decorated for  Halloween.  As noted in another review, our room did have a slight chemical odor when we first entered that quickly dissipated.  We saw this as a good thing because it told us the room had been thoroughly cleaned and sanitized prior to our stay. Carol, our housekeeper was very attentive to our needs while keeping a safe distance.  The room was nicely appointed with dishes and cookware and we had plenty of towels and cozy bedding.  The hotel was very quiet with ample parking.  We will definitely stay there again",2022-01-17 20:35:56 UTC,5,1,0,0,ycyvSUPqKLJH1MqjLwC-zQ

My wife and I were in town on vacation and wanted to get out onto the water.  However, we did not want to go with a large group or spend a lot of money.  I came across Charter Finders and saw they were veteran owned.  I contacted them via telephone, they answered all of my questions, and were extremely polite. 

They offer a discount for veterans and first responders which was nice and was a draw for us.  We knew we were likely in good hands. The boat leaves from Sea Dog Brewery which was great for grabbing drinks to go and bring with! They make a good seltzer FYI.  

Dean and Tim had a cooler with ice on board where you could throw your own booze.  There were only 6 other people on board and it made for a much better experience.  We made friends and just sat back and relaxed. We were able to see dolphins up close on the way to shell key island and back. (See attached photo) 

Once we were at shell key advice was provided as to where to find shells.  Some of us had high success.  We were unable to snorkel due to visibility.  The island is beautiful and not populated. 

The trip was roughly 3 hours long, but they were nice enough to extend it an hour so we got very very lucky.  We highly recommend Dean & Tim and cannot wait to go again in the future.",2021-03-11 01:49:20 UTC,5,0,0,0,v5zY0Nt7X8FWuNJGg4PShg

We purposely chose this airport since they had free airport transfers and it seemed newer/newly renovated which usually means it's a little bit cleaner. The hotel definitely was clean, but felt like a college campus dorm meets a doctors office. Bright colors everywhere, little artwork, very sterile feeling.  The rooms seemed a lot smaller than a typical budget hotel but weren't terrible- It could potentially feel a little tight for a family of 4+. The big complaint was the loud WHOOSH of airplanes passing over the hotel over and over again. If you're a light sleeper, this might not be the hotel for you, but if you can get past it then this might be a good lower cost option.",2021-10-29 00:05:49 UTC,3,1,1,2,sNVp0r4qPbE5J8fqNmCksg

I booked it way in advance because she knew exactly what she wanted for her special day. On the day of the event which was last Saturday, a bus pulled up and it wasn't the bus I paid for or ordered. No one from the company even bothered to alert me that there was a change. It was just a plain bus compared to the decked out bus the bride wanted and requested. The bus driver said that a bus had broken down and they contracted her out to service our trip. I went along with it because I had 20 guests at my house and had no other options. For the next seven days I have called, hardly spoken to people and when I did they kept saying they would call me back to resolve the issue of the incorrect bus that was sent. The bus driver got a hold of my number and called me and yelled at me during the week and I was completely caught off guard and ended up having to block her number after her multiple call backs. I have had a terrible experience getting a hold of anyone and when I do they are super rude on the phone and then nothing comes of it. I would never recommend booking this company solely for their customer service. They clearly don't know what they're doing and don't bother helping customers with their questions or concerns.

Had a reservation placed for a 16"" truck weeks in advance at the Fairview Heights, IL location. Was told they had no trucks. so they moved my reservation to this one instead. I go to pick it up only to find out that the customer support team cancelled my reservation without my knowledge or consent. The front desk worker did nothing to help the situation as it was ""out of their power,"" but in hindsight could've just called customer service to set things straight. Instead they told me I could call them. So I called them, and while I was on the phone with them, I watched the worker take another guest out to the  last truck on the lot that had I reserved. Unbelievable.

I was offered up to $250 compensation if I booked with a competitor. There were no trucks available anywhere as this was the end of July which is a hot date for moving. I took what I could get in order to move my stuff out of my apartment, otherwise suffer $500/day for overstay fees - so I booked an SUV. Budget said they couldn't validate it because it was an SUV and was only willing to give me $25 in good gesture even though they put me in a hopeless situation.

We rented a lux suv for a long road trip months in advance through Expedia for a reasonably good rate.  Upon arrival, we were informed by the employee at the counter that ""this location doesn't get lux suvs"" and that we would have to go to the airport location which was 30 mins away.  My first thought was; why were we allowed to make the reservation in the first place?  The employee then informed us that they had called us the day before and left a message letting us know.  We unfortunately missed the message.  The employee's tone seemed to suggest the error was ours for not getting the 24 hour notice and reacting accordingly.  The employee had zero interest in helping us beyond that.  We ultimately had to make a new last minute reservation at a much higher price elsewhere.

We booked them for my wedding on 8/7/21. 
Our driver showed up 20 minutes late and had been smoking in the party bus. We were late, so I didn't say anything and we rushed on. We almost got in numerous accidents, he didn't listen to our directions, got lost in downtown St. Charles where the streets were too narrow to go down with a bus, and made us even later for pictures. We lost about an HOUR of planned pictures before the ceremony due to him. 
After the ceremony, we all loaded back on the bus to go to the reception site for pictures. He was passed out on the bus. One of my bridesmaids went to wake him up, called for him, and had to shake him vigorously to wake him up. He pulled out from the ceremony, pulled into a QuikTrip and ran inside. Didn't say a word to us. I was absolutely furious. We were already late, had missed time to take pictures before the ceremony, and now we lost MORE time. He took 15 minutes in QuikTrip, came out with snacks, and drove to the ceremony site. He drove 25MPH on highway 94, drove in the center of the road, and we were once again late due to him. The drive out to the winery was in near silence because my entire wedding party was terrified that we weren't going to make it there. 
My photographer was furious, we lost two hours of photography due to him. This is time we will never get back, pictures we wont have from our wedding due to an incompetent driver. We have reached out to the company and were told ""he had a late job the night before so he was tired"". I work nightshift, I ALWAYS have a late job, but I don't let that impact others. 
Stay away from this company, they nearly ruined my wedding day and I will never be able to get this time or the missed pictures back. We were so looking forward to time with our wedding party in the bus, having a good time, driving around and taking pictures, but all of that was lost due to this company and that awful driver.",2021-08-23 18:42:44 UTC,1,0,0,0,rIEfU6AwJKPJmb7UGvxVzw

Upper story units have a teeny tiny deck hardly big enough for 1 person.  First thoughts on GW as a whole. Grounds are kept neat and tidy. Pool is warm and clean and the whole pool area is sanitized each morning by a very friendly guy who we always saw working hard. GW is right next to Upham beach so access is amazing. We walked everywhere and felt safe doing so. We saw many families enjoying the pool and always felt welcome there from the snowbirds that call this home. The beach cops patrol and are on top of things atleast what we saw. Now our unit 1201. Unit as a whole was fine for the 2 of us. Newer sofa bed, but we didn't sleep on it so can't attest for comfort. Nice shower and towels were good and plentiful. Kitchen stocked with useful items. The provided beach chairs were crappy so I was glad we had our own. The unit is in dire need of a good cleaning. Housekeeping comes after you check out and does the basics, but that is it. There was hair all over the ridiculously uncomfortable recliner and sofa so we covered those with the extra bed sheets. The headboard is filthy and caked with dust (see pic). Be sure to bring dish soap, extra toilet paper and garbage bags because they don't provide extras like a hotel. The bed wasn't terrible, but the sheet s are super cheap and scratchy (another reviewer said burlap and that is accurate). The extra blanket has a huge hole in it. The pillows were awful. It has updated flooring and an ok tv with lots of channels. Some units have their own WIFI but 1201 does not. The GW wifi is super slow just as other revierews stated.

While on this long vacation we are staying at hotels in the Hilton family.  Last one was perfection, not one tiny thing to complain about. The room, customer service and the nice little perks. 
This one is okay, just not the little things that make you happy. 
Right away you see there is no complimentary water and newspapers. My son was really disappointed there were no cookies either.  ( if there was we didn't find them)
We were given room 208 that backed up to a road that was pretty loud but luckily it slowed down at night.  
I walked in and almost fell because the floor was slick, I was wearing sketchers so I thought that was weird I was super careful the rest of the stay. 
Last room had enough bath products for the the three of us. This hotel barely gives for one.  I'm sure I could have asked but I didn't want to deal with it. 
No plug on one side of the bed, that's the one the air conditioning unit was plugged in to. Just as the floor was slippery so was the shower. Did not have that issue in last place with this. 
No jacuzzi, just small pool.  
My sons' bed had the worse squeak to it, every time he moved positions it would wake me up the sound.  
The bathroom had a slide door. I like a regular locking door. This didn't lock and no fan in the bathroom.  These are all things are last one had that made us comfortable. The things I mentioned may not be a big deal to some.  Just in case I wanted to make it known.  

** our last night there when we pulled in the back lot there was a car with two young girls and a guy. Soon as we were walking to the locked door he walked up and I think I got high just from the smell. He was trying to get into the hotel when we unlocked it. My hubby didn't let him in. They were waiting for a girl to come out and again a contact high when she passed us. They looked to be under 21. They were definitely up to know good. This area had a very different vibe to it.

CHANGED OUR ROOM RATE FROM $96 TO $179 AND DIDN'T TELL US!! I've stayed at many Hilton hotels in the past with no issues. There were many other hotel options available back in June when we booked our reservation (4 rooms), I chose this hotel primarily because of the low Honors Discount nightly rate. I checked in all the rooms as normal and then requested a printout of the folio upon check out and was told that it would be emailed to me. I discovered that there were rate discrepancies when I checked my emails after I got home. My room rate was locked in at $96 per night for 4 rooms but they switched my room rate to $179 per night without giving me any notice at all, literally ZERO notification/communication of the rate change! Because of this they've scammed me out of almost a THOUSAND DOLLARS! I even still have my confirmation email showing when I booked and how much my room rate was supposed to be but they didn't want to help me out at all, further more they would not even give me a reason for the room rate change. How could you not even be able to explain what happened to a customer? Super shady and unethical if you ask me, that's not how Hilton does things. Imagine having your room rate changed and them telling you to just deal with it even if you have all the proper documentation straight from Hilton. I asked the front desk manager Adam what I should do in this situation and he told me to ""Just accept everything how it is."" WOW hope anyone that reads this protects their family by staying away from here.

My husband and I recently stayed at the Four Seasons New Orleans for 5 nights. We live in New Orleans and with Hurricane Ida approaching our city in late August- we needed a place that we thought was safer then staying in our home. We  booked with our travel agent and also worked with  Henry the Reservation Manager at the hotel.

I don't even know where to begin with how wonderful the staff treated us during our stay. The hotel only took in a small amount of  guests so that the hotel employees could be housed there during the hurricane. That surely says something about a hotel to do that. So not only did we get to know so many of the staff but also their children and dogs too!

The décor of our suite was beautifully furnished. The marble bathroom had the largest walk in shower I have ever seen. There was also a soaking tub. The bed was so comfortable and the linens were of the finest quality.

We were treated like royalty! The service by all the staff we encountered was beyond belief!

We were escorted to our room by Rutendo the Hotel Assistant Manager who explained everything in the room. In all our years of traveling to the most luxurious hotels all over the world- no one was on the same level as Rutendo when he showed us to our room. There was sure a lot to explain- such as all lighting is customized, bedside controls for drapery and a  iPad for in-room controls and all services at the hotel including in room dining. He spent time setting up my husband's computer and connected all our devices to wifi. Thank you Rutendo for you amazing service. Four Seasons is very lucky to have such a passionate employee like you.

The Front Desk staff were always courteous, kind, engaging and very helpful, providing great service with the best attitudes.  Thanks to Chad, Bobby, Tien, Nick, Paula, Melissa and a special thanks to Darrium- you surely have the best personality and are an extraordinary person.

Since the restaurant was closed during the hurricane we had room service in our room the first couple of days, then the air condition went out in our room- so they set up a table for us to eat in the lobby with portable air condition machines. Now that is unbelievable!  Fini, the supervisor of  in room dining took our orders every day. She was wonderful explaining the menu and taking our orders. Thank you Fini for your service and patience with us. Thanks to Jamesha who served us in our room and Nuri in the lobby for your great service. We even had a couple of delicious cocktails made by Hadi.

To our buddy, Sean Johnson in security who we loved talking to every night eating our meals in the lobby. Also met Brandon and Andrew- Director of Security.

Thank you to the Housekeeping Staff who cleaned our room to PERFECTION! Gina the Director of Housekeeping and her staff, Yalily, Dinora, Alicia and Angel- we were so grateful for your service.

Thanks to Isaiah in Valet for your amazing service.

Service like this at a hotel does not just happen without the direction of their Managers- Ekrem (Hotel Manager) and Mali Carrow the General Manager. I had the pleasure of speaking with Mali and she is truly the backbone of this hotel.

She is a delightful and warm person who made our stay so special. During the hurricane she had to contend with so many decisions on what was best for her staff and hotel guests. I was so impressed. What a remarkable job you did Mali!

You and your staff exemplify the Four Seasons Golden Rule-""to treat others as you wish to be treated."" Mali you have set the standard for your staff to provide all your hotel guests with wonderful experiences. (Even during a Hurricane!).

Thank you to all the Employees at the Four Seasons New Orleans for a stay we will always remember.",2021-10-05 03:15:57 UTC,5,1,0,2,zLfBJC2y8osqmcHpsUY28w

While it was expensive, we felt it was worth the investment to keep ourselves and our family safe.  The initial process of being shown the RV and making the reservation went very well and they answered all the questions we had.  

My reason for the 1-star review is this.  When we rented the RV, we were told that no one would be in the office the DAYof our return - Monday, December 28, 2020.  We were not told that no one would be there the entire week to check in the vehicle after we'd returned it.  As such, it sat on their lot for 7 days and nights with no one checking it in.  On January 4th, I received a notice that I would have to pay for damage to the ladder on the rear of the RV.  Having not damaged the ladder, I wasn't sure what they were referring to, so I asked for pictures.  The bottom of the ladder was bent out as if something had pulled on it from the bottom rung.  Total for the repair was about $166

Since I believed someone would be checking it in the morning after I returned it, I didn't bother with taking pictures or a video of the vehicle when I dropped it off.  As such, I'm now responsible for the damage that was done (even though I didn't do it).  No proof = my fault I suppose.  

I've been told that they ""bent"" their normal policy so I wouldn't have to pay for unused nights.  Apparently the bend in the policy didn't include someone coming to check the vehicle in the next day.  

I've rented my first and last RV from Nashville RV.",2021-01-05 16:38:04 UTC,1,0,0,0,4GGUgEq9xdHosdATz_jDog

As soon as I heard a four seasons was coming to town I immediately booked my trip. Even though they were hit by hurricane ida a month ago things are indeed coming back to life. 

The hotel is located on the first 18 floors of the old World Trade Center tower. Short walk to canal street with a saks right around the corner. You can easily take the river walk path to the French quarter. It was nice to be away from the action but still lots of construction going on so it was pretty noisy during my stay even though I was 10 floors up. Bring ear plugs if you are a light sleeper. Spa, fitness center, and pool are not open yet. They have passes to use a pool at a nearby hotel but I didn't bother- I know I'll be disappointed. 

As a FS loyal guest I know what is to be expected. I would say the service is not 100% there but with time they will get there. Ren at the concierge did a fantastic job putting together my itinerary. Blaine at Miss River was an excellent server and bartender. A few requests I made via the iPad were a bit delayed but they are still learning. Housekeeping was great everytime I requested an early cleaning they showed up right away. There is no fridge in the room but ask and you shall receive. The beds and bathroom are top notch. I enjoyed taking a bath every night and looking out the window. The water pressure of the shower was very good. AC worked well sometimes too well I had to turn it off. It was quiet too I couldn't hear it humming at all. They give you complimentary unlimited amounts of smart water. I ordered room service everyday and the food was hot and delicious. A few times they forgot a napkin. The chandelier bar is beautiful and they have live music on the weekends which was lovely. 

All in all excellent stay. 4 days was plenty to explore the big easy! The people, the culture, the food really ignites your soul! I will be back for sure and wouldn't stay anywhere else but the Four Seasons!

This year in 2021, after two long years of quarantining and covid, we wanted to try One11.

What drew us to One11 Hotel was its new construction, proximity, great rooftop access, and modern interior design. After a three-night stay, our initial thoughts however were turned upside down. One11 still has a way to go to compete with the other hotels in the quarter.

PROS:
- The cleanest hotel in NOLA. Not sure if it's because it's a new hotel, or that we came during covid times, but everything was COMPLETELY SPOTLESS.

- Ideal proximity to everything you need in NOLA. The riverfront and canal streetcars are only a block away. You can take the less populated riverfront trail to go to the square, the market, and even Cafe DuMonde.

- Amazing rooftop views. Especially during covid times, we enjoyed taking our food to go and bringing it up to the rooftop to eat. Unfortunately, there is limited seating up there (just 2 tables, and two sofas)

- Spaciousness and completely modern king rooms, which is hard to come by in a city as old as NOLA


CONS:
- Although One11 used to be an old sugar factory, the steel beams, and solid structure DO NOT MUFFLE SOUNDS. Unless you're on the 8th floor, you hear all your neighborhoods above. EVERYTHING. Full-on conversations, music, and sounds (as if you are there next to them). It is worst at night.

- The bedding/linen situation is quite odd. No fitted sheet. Just one top sheet tucked over the mattress, then two top sheets covering a bare duvet. Everything gets all over the place, and with no room service, it's a bit complicated to fix the bed in the morning. Note that the pillows are also very thin, flat, and uncomfortable.

- There is a freight train that comes by and honks repeatedly all throughout the day and night, be prepared for more noise. Please note that this is not the hotel's fault, just something to keep in mind when booking.


ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- One11 provides a pair of earplugs in the top drawer under the Keurig, but they don't help much.

- No room service during covid, but we like it this way. I know others may not.

- The Mini fridge/cooler is hidden as one of the drawers (under the Keurig) It's super small, only fitting a few cans of soda. Not much.

- Keycard elevator access, only. You must scan your room key to use the elevator.

OVERVIEW:
Would we consider staying at One11 again, probably not. The noise/echoing issue was a huge turn-off, and we come from the largest city in the US (we're used to bustling city noises and crazy apartment neighbors). There are better options in NOLA.",2022-01-01 01:03:21 UTC,3,0,0,0,Rnpmb9AUc2zb7ogJV_kU-w

It is definitely shady! They charge you tens of thousands of dollars claiming to assist you with getting out of a timeshare contract but they all work together to screw you over. You should not have to pay a company thousands of dollars to do nothing but have you do all the work and then drag your case on for a few years to assure that they get thousands of dollars from you. It is a scam no matter what they try to prove and say to you. One screw you over to join the other screws you over claiming they can get you out of the contract...They both work together and everyone gets paid in the end at your expense. 

The best advice to anyone is to NOT purchase any timeshares, it is a shady business and the way they make money from families. It is just NOT worth it! 

Get a free consultation from an attorney and ask for guidance on how to do it yourself and share it with several media news outlets.

I confronted the man at the front desk who I believe is the owner and he told me that he personally cleaned my room and there was no money present at the time of the cleaning. Which is a complete lie. He then tells my boss that his ""housekeeper of 6 years"" was the one who cleaned my room and has never been accused of stealing.

There also was a dirty glass in the kitchen sink. That is absolutely unacceptable, especially with covid being such an issue and this company advertising how thoroughly they clean and disinfect!!
2) The hot and cold lever on the shower was backward!! Thank God my son didn't get burned!! He knows to turn the water on more toward cold and then adjust to warmer water after he gets in the shower, to avoid getting burned. Thankfully he saw the steam and realized it was hot before getting in!!

-the TV, modem, cable box and phone were on the floor in the master bedroom
-there was a large stain on the carpet near the nightstand in the master bedroom
-the fan didn't work in the master bedroom (the pull chain was broken off)
-the light didn't work in one closet in the master bedroom
-the remote was taped together in master bedroom
-the carpet was pulling away from the entrance to the master bath, so the tack strip was exposed (not awesome when stepped on)
-the blinds were broken in the master bath
-there was packaging material, including staples on the carpet in the master bedroom
-there was no bag in the vacuum, so the above issue was cleaned up by hand. (Definitely didn't want a staple in my foot!!)

We couldn't even find our unit when we got here because they had painter's tape all over everything. The painters left an eyesore if a machine in front of our balcony during sunset time. 
Separately from the paint situation- The first thing I noticed was water over the floors when I arrived. We wasted 2 days of our vacation waiting for maintenance people to come. 1st it was the A/C person and the next day it was the carpet cleaning people. The carpet cleaning people left a huge industrial fan which was extremely loud in our unit for 4 days. Don't stay in building 9! Everything is beautiful on the outside, but this isn't the vacation we planned for, so I hope to get a partial refund. The property manager did call to apologize for inconveniences, but I haven't heard anything since then.

I think it was called the Tap Room. We ended up making our way out of the hotel and we had fun exploring. The next day again came downstairs for some breakfast and there was Jeff smiling and called us by name like we were old friends, most hotels barely does anyone know your name, he told us about this little Cuban restaurant and it wasn't to far away so we got to try good Cuban food!

Apparently, this is the place to stay in St Pete. This was a great location, right in the middle of downtown. Parking is free and there really was no need to drive anywhere. We walked everywhere the entire weekend. The building has a lot of history...that being said. Certain rooms are renovated and some aren't. The ac units in the windows have birds living in them. Nothing more annoying then hearing chirping early in the morning. Lucky for us, we didn't have any birds. The pool area is very nice and relaxing. Certain mornings they do have yoga. There's an outdoor bar area if you need a drink. The staff is friendly and there to serve you. When I was laying out, there is a person walking around asking if you would like some water. Coming here in June, you sometimes forget how easily dehydrated you can become. There's a restaurant inside and a coffee bar at the end. The decor is beautiful and I recommend taking a walk up the stairs. You will see some wonderful pictures. Our room was one of the renovated rooms(pretty happy about that) so I'm not sure what the original rooms compared too. Our room was nicely decorated and clean. There's a small refrigerator inside, which came in very handy. Especially, after waking up hung over and desperately wanting my leftover sub in the refrigerator. The simple things in life after a long night, is lots of cold water and carbs. Thank you for keeping those items cold and fresh.

The food and the staff in the restaurant/bar were great! Best hotel food I've had in awhile and I travel a lot. Now the opportunities for improvement. I was looking forward to a Sunday relaxing at the pool....not to be. The pool is open to the public on Sunday (wow, was not told at check-in) and no chairs were available. I spoke to a manager (may have been the owner)  as I thought inviting the general public into a pool when a paying guest couldn't enjoy advertised amenities was not the customer service I was expecting in a boutique hotel and I'd be including it in my review. I was told I was just mean. Yep, stating the facts is just mean. Other than this lovely experience, I didn't appreciate staff demanding to go through my purse/bag to ""check for glass"" every time I went to the pool...really...a boutique hotel? Felt like I was going through TSA security. Last piece of feedback, the room air conditioners need an upgrade. I couldn't do work-related Zoom calls, because my colleagues said it sounded like I was in a boiler room. Sleeping with the noise level was tough and I'm a championship sleeper!

No mention of this age when you book and I thought I was fine since you typically have to be 18 and then at least 21. So, the guy says we can't stay there. Did I mention it's 10 pm at night? He did not offer to help us find a place to stay or anything. We thought it was funny because we were allowed to rent a mustang from Hertz, but we can't stay in a hotel room. Also, they can't give you your money back if you need to cancel and booked through hotels.com.

The food is great.  Like many people we ate outside on the back patio.  I was especially impressed by our waiter, Langdon.  He was the bar keep, server and in our case set up a heater, as the temperature was quite chilly in the early part of the evening.  His winning personality, attentiveness to detail was amazing.  He knew what drinks we had ordered, food that we selected and came back to check on us in just the right amount of time.  I never like restaurants where the server is overly attentive.  It is obvious that Langdon has had a lot of experience in the hospitality business.  He was wearing many hats and made his job seem easy.  The only unfortunate thing about eating by the pool was that you couldn't have a real martini glass, but instead had to settle for plastic.  I prefer my martini glass chilled, but in this case it didn't matter as it was so cold outside that the temperature remained in a chilled state.  I feel that Langdon should be made an assistant manager, as he joked with us and made us feel important, even though he had a lot of people to serve between the bar patrons and customers seated by the pool.  

My partner and I shared the Ruben Sandwich, which has always been a favorite of mine, and of course when dining out, and sharing, ordered the fries.  

In general, I feel the Hollander Hotel is one of the best restaurants to enjoy for the ambiance of the hotel lobby and front porch and when we can enjoy it again, the weekend brunch.

We were put on 1st floor with close proximity to the lobby, Tap Room and Pool which is convenient, however it is fairly loud. Constantly hear doors shutting, people talking, and walking  in the hallway. I think because it such an old building it is not very sound proof. Also the smell takes some getting used to. Had a strong odor of oldness mixed with Pine cleaner. Took about 2 days for that to fade out. In all I would stick to the mid level high rise type of hotel, but that is just my preference.

We were super excited to go on our first air balloon ride, from the reviews we saw that this was a good company to go through. However... Our experience quite the opposite. We started the morning at the Bob Evans parking lot, then the driver got lost and went 30 minutes in the wrong direction. The advertised hour of flight time was quite the opposite, we had a questionable 15 minutes in the air. After landing in a unauthorized field, which we locked in, we had to pack up our balloon while our captain searched for a way to get us out. After being stuck in the field for at least 1 hour, we proceeded to spend 2-3 hours searching for another balloon that was lost from our group. After finding the balloon and making our way back to Bob Evans, we were finally offered our complimentary champagne toast in the rear parking lot of the Bob Evans. There was no breakfast in the air instead, we received a 20$ gift card to Bob Evans, which was closed when we go back. We reached out to Big Red Balloon about our unsatisfactory experience and they seemed to not care and stated that it is an unpredictable experience based on the weather, they wouldn't even give a discount for our time. 400$ For me and my boyfriend, for only 15 minutes of flight time.

Also loved looking at the beautiful water across the street. Took us an hour to walk the entire park. We will definitely be staying here again.

They are totally absurd, on a Friday (9/3/21) evening at 5p there was a lot of evidence of that in a mostly empty dining room.  Locals will go elsewhere with these prices.  The food used to always be good, not so much now.  The bacon was all but tasteless, a big disappointment, in the past it's been good.  The pancakes were ok except for the bottom kept separating as it was very tough and the syrup was close to tasteless.  There were 4 of us (locals) and we were all very unhappy with our food.  And to charge $4.25 for a glass of lemonade is absurd, and it had a strange flavor, not the usual lemonade we all liked.  But the worst was being charged $4.25 for a cup of coffee!!!  Have you lost your minds?  The whole time we were there the place was all but vacant.  Locals won't go there to eat if you keep this up.  For a casino your prices are just absurd.

The other issue is the wait staff, several including our waitress had their mask under their nose 99% of the time, come on, it doesn't take a brain surgeon to know the mask goes over your nose!!!  And wearing a mask with a metal clip is meant to be pressed over the nose to keep your mask up, again it doesn't take a brain surgeon to know and do that!!!  Either the manager is blind or just doesn't care.

We have always enjoyed eating there in the past, but it will be a long time before we go back if we do, and that isn't just our opinion, I have heard this same thing from a lot of locals.  A couple that was waiting to check out behind us said in the future they would go to McDonalds, and that's a fact.

The hotel itself comes off a bit outdated and grungy but the rooms themselves proved to be pretty nice.

The hotel is separate from the casino which is great in itself. Neither of us are smokers and I usually prefer to stay somewhere that doesn't reek of tobacco. Although you can't fully prevent that in a casino filled city, the separation from the slots and tables did help just a bit.

You enter the hotel via your access key. For security reasons, you have to enter through two doors before making it into the actual hotel lobby. They provide hand sanitizer stations around the complex.

We stayed in a large king bed room with had a large TV, lamps, coffee maker, mini fridge, and a makeshift desk. There's no office chair or any real setup for the desks however so if you're planning on doing any Zoom calls, you may need to find a better location for your background. The bed was very comfortable and the heating/ac unit was working well. Bathroom was standard albeit on the smaller end - their shower head was shockingly low.

Although the area feels a bit shady at night, during the day it's quite lovely. You are walking distance from the nearby Marina Park, where you can enjoy a gorgeous walk around the perimeter and end up at the Legends shopping complex. I loved being able to do this scenic walk with the mountains in the backdrop.

Overall, a pretty good stay here for a few nights away from Downtown Reno. Would we stay here again? Maybe if it's cheap enough, but if comparable to other major casinos or hotels, definitely opt in for something different.",2021-03-24 17:24:40 UTC,3,1,2,2,ge8UyR11GCzy3fuPOHU9dQ

Everything started off great. My room is updated and actually really nice. The size is a little small but it's clean and appointed. Check in was smooth and the lady was gracious and helpful. Most the employees that I dealt with were very helpful and just plain old nice. The casino is updated and contains some of my favorite restaurants in Reno. I am from here. My family and I have worked for the Peppermill before. On Good Friday the casino is packed with all sorts of characters. My biggest complaint about the casino is that the parking lot is cleaner than the casino area. It was ridiculously dirty. Spilled drinks. Cigarettes put out directly on machines. Papers and trash were on the machines. It made me uncomfortablento gamble. I returned back to my room after gambling to find out that the cable for the TV was out. I called throughout the night and was told ""sorry but we don't know what's going on."" Finally I spoke with Lisa who told me that they had to have people from the Peppermill come over to do some work. I didn't know Peppermill was a cable company. Same thing Saturday. Same thing Sunday. For my 3 night stay I have had no cable. It's a 1st world problem but I paid for the services, right? When I went to the front desk in person I spoke with Kandace. It's hard to tell facial expressions with our masks on but she hardly said a word to me. No sorry, no we are trying to fix it. HOWEVER she did put 20 dollars in comps on my players card. That was kind but once again it was like she didn't have the time. She didn't even say have a nice night, I did though. This all occured my 2nd night. I called housekeeping when I got back to my room to ask for more coffee and cups only to find out that my phone doesn't work either. It will only call the front desk. Front desk answered and once again she made it seem like I was waisting her time BUT 20 minutes later security showed up to my room with a big bag of goodies so obviously she is looking out for me. After 2 nights with no sleep I realized how loud the property is. There are people yelling and honking and burning rubber in the parking lot constantly. The doors slam like somebody is doing construction. It's LOUD here. With no TV I think it made it worse. I spent 300 dollars at the steak house (AMAZING MEAL AND A MUST GO) 300 dollars to stay for 3 nights. Not counting the small amount of gambling that I did. I would spend the extra cash and stay at Hampton Inn across the Marina or anywhere else in Reno Sparks. Only come here for the Steakhouse. Unacceptable.

The ambiance was nice, the service was excellent and the food was delicious. We had fried lobster appetizer and petit filet mignon with salad and potatoes au gratin. The lobster was sweet, crispy and tender. Perfect melt in your mouth bites. My steak was cook to perfection. It was rear and a little charred outside. Yum! The potatoes, salad and roasted veggies on the side did not disappoint. They offer blueberry sorbet with or without champagne as a palate cleanser   Such a nice touch! We accompanied our meal with a nice bottle pinot gris recommended by our server. We did not have desert but we had Diablo coffee to finish the night. Warning: lots of alcohol not much coffee. It's prepared table side and it's such a fun experience and a great night cap. The ambiance is great. Nice, roomy, well lit. It does not have the dark, stuffy feeling that so many steak houses have. Our booth was nice and comfy. It felt intimate and private without being isolated from the rest of the space. The staff was excellent: personable, well trained and ready to answer any questions.

I highly recommend getting City Pass to get the best deal for your money. You can see several great places in the area with it and it's so much cheaper than doing it individually. We had great weather on our visit so the walk around the zoo was great. We saw so many animals easily. If you don't have a membership you can still go online and sign up for experiences. We did the white rhino experience and it was a very fair price for what you can do. It's running once a day right now at 11a.m. It's a 30 minute experience at $20 each for non members. They have opened it up to 15 people on tour each day as of right now. The keepers were so kind and knowledgeable. Anna is delightful. I can't remember the other keepers names, but they were all fantastic. The new baby rhino is a month old and was right with the mom while we were able to touch and pet her.  If you aren't able to snag a spot for the experiences you'll still have a great time. There is a pizza place in the Africa section of your map that offers gluten free pizza and has wings as well. Bonus!!!  What a great day with your family or friends. The whole zoo was clean and the maps were very handy.  There's free parking and no need to wait in line if you have City Pass or a membership. When you arrive through the front the staff taking your pictures in front of the green screen are fun and have a treat at the photo desk when you're done. Meaning: you won't know why they tell you to look up, or surprised, or scared, but they'll show you at picture pick up. Have fun and enjoy!",2021-07-14 23:20:46 UTC,5,0,0,0,Tuf3rhyF71nt4O9aXPCPgw

My three yr. old's definitely had a blast seeing the animals and playing in the Wallaby kid area. My girl's both got their faces painted and the artist who painted their faces was nice and also fast! Although the Wallaby kid area is still open many of the rides in that area are closed during this time. The splash pad, small aviary, playground, two rides, and dining spot are amongst some of the things open in that area. The petting zoo had animals visible, but no one is allowed into the petting area.

You definitely have to do the Expedition Africa Safari Tram Ride while visiting. This ride is included with admission and takes you around to some of the major animal exhibits. If you're short on time or have little ones who prefer to linger in the kid area most of the day, then taking this trek is a great way to maximize your time and animal interaction. You can see so much in just 15 minutes!

Mask are not required while outside, but they are recommended. All visitors must practice social distancing and must wear mask while inside. You must also mask up while riding on the Safari Trek.",2021-02-08 17:29:07 UTC,5,3,0,4,2X6Abndnqmyi0VCA3dNHYA

I was in line to go on the merry go round. When I was in line I was greeted by one of the workers. Then when I proceeded to get on the ride right before the merry go round was going to start, he promptly told me I couldn't ride the merry go round and didn't really give a reason why. I have so many questions, first being why? And where did it say there was an age or weight limit? I'm 163 pounds and 5'3 and I'm midsized. And secondly, why did the worker not tell me AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE RIDE so it would've saved me time from lining and I would've left. I, of course, didn't want to start a scene so I complied. I'm very disappointed and wish he was more clear about the guidelines. I understand there was many kiddie rides and it was geared more towards children but I thought maybe AT LEAST the merry go round would take me since I've been on it once before in 2019. 

We spent 87 bucks for 2 people to come in and it was not worth the money as a lot of exhibits and rides were closed and it's a very small zoo. The food was also stale and was overpriced, I get it's a tourist attraction but atleast give out what people are paying for, ie) fresh food. 

THE ONLY GOOD THING I CAN SAY IS that the workers on the trolley were very friendly. I tried calling their guest services number today but no one picked up and was put on hold for a while. In conclusion, this place is a waste of money and time and you could probably finish the whole zoo in about 2 hours.",2021-01-10 20:02:01 UTC,2,0,1,2,5ix5rGeJ_FqRicFHPWo2JQ

Tampa was next on my check list of zoos and it certainly didn't disappoint. BUT note that this is a popular zoo and it does get crowded! I was surprised to find such a long line for ticket purchase. Luckily they had many employees working and the line moved quickly. 

Hot selling point is the current special ""Buy a Day"" ticket. If you purchase one regular ticket, you can return any day for free! There are some blackout dates though. But such a great deal! And for those noting that this zoo is expensive.. yes it is a bit pricier than your average small zoo. So why is a zoo this size charging more for admission than the Bronx? Simple. This zoo offers an array of amusement rides that are available with your general admission ticket. If you are less than enthused about the price and/or the rides, check out a different zoo. There are several within less than two hours. 

Anyhow, I was enthusiastic to visit the zoo behind the popular series ""Secrets of The Zoo"". My enthusiasm wasn't without cause. Despite its size. ZooTampa has a great collection of animals. The grounds are beautiful and the habitats carefully maintained. Everything is grouped by region so locating your favorite animals is fairly simple. Although-the signage could be better. Not a huge deal. Just download the map on your phone prior to entry. 

Upon trekking throughout the different habitats, I was delighted to meet with several keepers and volunteers. They made the experience memorable with their wealth of information. I really enjoyed speaking with volunteer, Jim in the manatee exhibit! 

All around a great zoo and a fun visit. Only thing I wished I could have done was the ""Expedition Africa"" tram ride. The line was unbelievably long due to only one team running. Over an hour wait! Seems like a zoo with this kind of popularity should run additional vehicles and keep lines moving but maybe next time. The animals were visible on foot just fine! I also wish that covid protocols were stricter but being outdoors with room for distance made me feel safe. 

Free and ample parking and ability to return for free with my day ticket!",2021-01-02 16:28:35 UTC,5,3,1,6,7botoQMpIVnrxFYljNKHYQ

They have all the big animals that kids recognize right away.  My daughter loved feeding the giraffe.  There are many other activities to do as well but your have to be 5+.  If you are a Tampa Bay Area local I highly recommend getting a pass to save in the long run and help support the zoo.  The pass also makes for a great gift for kids that are hard to shop for.  The parking is free and with membership you get preferred parking which is closer as well. There are other perks as well such as discounts at the shops, etc.  During this pandemic, the zoo has been a great place to be since its outdoors.  For more cautious people going first thing in the morning is best.  We got in first thing when it opened and left around 11am before it started getting busy.  You don't have to wear a mask in areas you can socially distance properly and for the most part others are respectful.  They give you a mask when entering the park if you don't already have one as basically ask you to use your best judgement.  Only the inclosed areas such as the manatee aquarium area Is where masks are mandatory.  I still find the layout a bit confusing but maybe the more we go the more used to it I'll be.  Also,  some of the signs were wrong due to construction I guess. Adding this to your list of outdoor activities definitely helps with variety for the kids.  Kids 2 and under are free with or without a membership. If you have small kids you only need about 2 hours.  If you have older children you can probably spend more time to do the extra featured excursion (all at additional cost).  Overall, check out the zoo especially if you have kids for a fun filled day of activities.",2021-01-08 03:24:40 UTC,4,2,1,2,B6o6VzxTfQJegfKhoNJmMA

Haven't been in many years and after watching their show on Disney+ wanted to see what might be new.

Many areas of the park are under construction and it looks like they're close to having a few new areas to visit.  It did make the park seem somewhat disjointed trying to get around certain areas.

I would say my favorite thing was the Safari Ride, although the ""side"" story of looking for the Professor was a bit monotonous after the first couple of times.  I did see plenty of eye rolls during the spiel.

I was a little disappointed that many of the animals were either hiding from the sun (who could blame them - it was hot), or not in their areas at all.  Truly seemed like we could have done the entire zoo in about 1.5 hours, which, for the cost, seems rather disappointing.

SD is set on hills requiring the use of a tram to really get around. ZT is flat! The big benefit of ZT, for me, is how close you can get to the animals. ZT also has a large kid's area with splash pads and other water features to entertain the kids on a hot summer day. SD does not. (* It has been a while since I was at SD so they may have installed something but I doubt it) SD does have more animals which is a plus but for kids, I don't think that is a big deal. The excitement I saw at ZT today was off the chart. I'm not sure if it would have been more with more animals.  My takeaway: ZT is everything a zoo should be with ease of navigation, face-to-face encounters with the animals (they offer extra-fee encounters with many of the animals), diversions for kids once they get tired or overheat, SD, to me, is more of a working zoo with lots of research going on. Now, the only real negative for ZT was the price of food. This is a family attraction. A large cheese pizza was more than $24.00. We had six chicken wings, a beer, and soda. The tab was $31.00! I kept looking for Mickey! Given the parking is free and there are picnic tables near the parking lot so a family can bring their own food. Visiting Tampa?

It's also safe to say ZooTampa is so different from every zoo I've been to- they have found a way to stand out and impress even me! It's soo fun! 

All the animals are grouped by the continent you can find them in naturally, and then there's a special section just for the celebrities you can find right in the backyard of FL! There are small amusement rides in every section and even shows throughout the day where you can interact up close and personal with various animals. Lots of little restaurants to eat at and stands to grab a quick drink or refresher. 

It's hard to even describe but somehow ZooTampa has found a way to make their park so much more homey, it doesn't feel so caged and like a circus or dirty and stuff like some other zoos feel. This feels just so nice and family-oriented, so laid back and purely enjoyable. I really am blown away impressed, so I say it's definitely worth the visit!",2021-03-03 21:25:19 UTC,5,1,0,1,Ll2vT2KldluPGtwRPWrtnA

Where do I start? The number of animals here is incredible. They have giraffes, tigers, rhinos, elephants, manatee, sea turtles, chimpanzee, koala, and even penguins. I loved all the different birds as well. There is a safari ride where you can see the animals a little closer but the wait time was about an hour so we didn't go.

There are rides here! In addition to the safari they have a water ride, small kid coaster, carousel, splash pad, and small playground. 

There are a lot of options for food and drinks here. We found a great food place in the Africa area that was air conditioned and had pizza and salads. Later, we found a small outdoor bar that had 2 for 1 draft beer from 1pm-4pm. Score!

Price is pretty high for a zoo (around $45 for an adult) but I think it is worth it. Parking is free. We have a zoo membership at another Florida zoo so we were able to get half off the ticket price.

For year I had an annual membership with Busch Gardens, which I held only for the zoo features of the park. One thing that I like about the zoo, especially in comparison to a Busch Gardens, is the family atmosphere. 

One unique aspect is that there are both African and Asian rhinos (full disclosure, I love rhinos). The orangutan exhibit is awesome. 

The African safari ride is nothing special, as for the most part you can view a number of the exhibits and enjoy closer by walking around to the exhibits.

This one is truly a must visit for any animal lovers. My whole family had a blast. I couldn't believe they had a safari ride on a giant Range Rover. They have one the most impressive exhibits on Manatees I have seen that is even better than at sea world. Most of your standard animals and birds are here. So I will only note the highlights bald Eagles, tigers, Komodo dragons, panthers( not currently viewable) but they are building a massive new expansion for them and the bears for the spring of 2022.

Now I would probably never expect to eat a good meal at a zoo. But I ate at the hamburger place and was blown away by how good it was. There are no premade frozen hockey pucks here. The burger was fresh and tasted great perfectly cooked. Was it expensive not much more than a nice restaurant. Also, while you can buy passes to the zoo or tickets the best deal is theCity Pass which covers the zoo and many other attractions.

Additionally, they weren't trying to squeeze every drop of money out of you. There was a whole kid section with a carousel, baby rides and a mini water section/splash pad. None of it cost extra and it was a ton of fun for the kids.

Cleanliness-wise and Covid wise masks are not required in outdoor areas and people are asked to maintain social distancing. Indoor areas such as the manatee tunnel, restaurants and restrooms they ask that you wear your mask and all of the staff wear masks. The staff also regularly clean surfaces that the guests use (such as the animals on the carousel).

We spent a large portion of the visit (about 3 hours) visiting the different exhibits and areas, categorized by locations (Savannah, Florida, Africa, etc.); which also correlates with the type of animals.

There weren't many animal feedings, shows, or workers available around the park and/or near the 'animal encounters' areas. Also, some of the times posted in the park - for show times - did not correlate with the app. However, we did enjoy the aquarium and manatee chat.

The animals of course make the whole place what it is. We love the animals. So many to see and explore and learn about! The petting zoo being shut down is very disappointing and is a contributor to the three stars. There is absolutely no reason for the petting zoo area to be closed off!!

Another reason for the 3 stars is the manatee encounter. Everytime I have gone to the zoo this year it is the same inappropriate, disrespectful and unprofessional employees working this station.

The aviary is a nice walk, where you see all kinds of different birds. Rumor has it a sloth lives there as well, but we never found him. I highly recommend the Indian Rhino Feeding. You don't realize how large those animals are until you are face to face with one. People 5 and older can participate in the feeding. They are not strict about masks which is refreshing. There is a nice ice cream shop, a hot dog stand, seafood options, as well as other food options. They also had a KONA ice truck, but I'm not sure if that's a regular thing or not. The animals were all very active and seemed to be very well taken care of. The staff was helpful and friendly and very passionate about the well-being of the animals.

Let me be clear. I am grateful for a week at the beach but that is also why I decided to write the truth. Someone somewhere is renting this condo and profiting off of people who get one week a year or maybe every other year to take a vacation. 

The good. Sheets were clean. The management company left extra trash bags toilet paper bath towels and dish tabs. The location is good for John's pass and the beach. It is nice that the building uses a code so that only people with the code can get up to your condo. 

The bad. This is a horribly outdated condo. See photos. There is duct tape on the cabinets. It is dirty and worn out. Couches are dingy and stained. The front bedroom has super nasty bedspreads. They are worn out and dirty. The back bedroom has new mattresses but they are hard as a rock and the headboards are loose so anytime you move they tap the wall. The window in the front bedroom doesn't lock. The sliding door doesn't lock.   (Thank goodness for that building code) There were no baking sheets and only 1 pan in the condo. The toilet paper holder in the main bedroom is mounted so low the paper is constantly on the ground. The tile in both bathrooms is dirty from wear. 

The noise from the road was so bad we slept with ear plugs the whole time. I would stay here again ... if this were the absolute last condo on the beach.

While they're not a full service garden center and nursery, having been in the agriculture business for decades in our area means there's a wealth of knowledge about farming and gardening in the high desert hiding in this lot on the corner of Kietzke and 2nd AND you can bet they can tell you what to do or where to find exactly what you're after in the area too.

Cary Yamamoto and his family have been farming in the high desert since the earlier part of the 1900s. While the business grew to be focused on sod, the generations of experience make this a great place to find what you need and get some valuable insights too. 

I mean, if you can grow grass in the desert then you should be able to grow anything right? I was waiting all night to write that out. Hope it lands like I thought it would! 

I dropped in for something totally unrelated to gardening, but when I remembered I needed a few bags of great soil for some tomato pots at home I was so happy to find a full selection of Full Circle soils just waiting for me! Pricing and info was easily understood on the pallets and after walking up to the window and paying, the team promptly loaded it into my truck! 

That's serious service, which you really don't find at the other places. 

I also loved the fact they sell the Full Circle products in cubic yards! That's a whole lotta soil BUT if you're doing some major overhauls that's the way to do it! 

I'm excited for their Bonsai Blue Farmer's Market to start June 17th. They have such a great array of produce and some vendors you don't find at the other markets, including their own goods!

Hello, don't we all want to clean more?   It's a ruse for them to make more money.   Also my room smelled.  It has not been deep cleaned for whenever,  I stayed because I was very tired but when I woke up in the middle of the night the room smelled like rotten eggs.

Now - I must say that we visited some of their wineries prior to our visit here.  First we were up at Firestone, which had excellent wines and a nice layout.  We then went to Lincourt which is now one of my top favorite wineries in the area to visit.  We had mentioned to our server there that we would be heading here and he was very excited as he used to work here and said we would be trying some of the best wines Foley had to offer.  
This is a beautiful small tasting room to visit.  It felt more like a hotel gift shop than a tasting room but maybe that was because the door was open and random people would pop their heads in as their Mercedes were being valet parked.  Parking is odd here - valet is pretty much mandatory unless you ignore them like we did and just go park it yourself, for free.
We paid for our tasting and tried a bunch of different wines.  I have to say, we didn't like many of them.  The ones up at the vineyards themselves were much smoother and vibrant and just overall awesome.  We were shocked that we didn't like many here, given that we expected the best of the best.  Our server gave us some info on the wines and was pleasant. 
We just didn't like the wines or the vibe.  Watching rich people get their cars parked while trying sour wines is not the best.  I wouldn't recommend going here.  Stick to the tasting rooms in the Funk Zone of Santa Barbara - we went there next and loved all the wines we had there (Specifically Riverbench).",2021-05-26 17:15:09 UTC,3,0,0,0,65NCP77fw8tVRldEhjpV0Q

I want to say that I understand that times are different during this pandemic so of course wait times are longer, BUT waiting an hour and a half to get someone to help you is absolutely unacceptable. I had a reservation at 1pm and arrived ON TIME. I didn't get to speak with anyone until a whole hour later and I didn't get into my vehicle until half an hour after that. The staff there was not organized at all. They even helped someone who came AFTER me. I let that slide seeing that they were understaffed and overwhelmed. 

Now the real issue is that during the whole check in process, the employee DID NOT explain to me what they were charging me for and what the documents were for. They just took my ID and credit card and had me sign my name on their device. I had to ask for them to explain to me what I was signing for. Seemed like they were just rushing me out the door. The vehicle they gave me barely had any gas in there. It was practically empty. The most I can drive is 35 miles before completely empty. The employee said he marked it as empty, but that was it. Before they let me go, they didn't confirm anything with me. I noticed that they had the same protocol with other customers as well, so it's not just me who had a bad experience.",2021-01-18 21:51:59 UTC,1,0,0,1,7hpp5k3rucyfFgw_vPp-KA

Pros. 
Easy check in 
The mattress and pillows were very comfortable! 
super accommodating fir check out. 
Room was clean and more nice than I would have thought. 
The value was great. 

Cons
The place was dirty. Carpet walls smell. 
The smell was a mix of India and funk.
The office chair in the bedroom was broken and looked like it was salvaged out of a store closing fire sale. 
No elevator 2 story
Only one ice machine it's on the bottom floor by the front office. 
No breakfast!!!

I had a Ballpark Village Courtyard view, room 805, and that was amazing. Nice oversized shower and what was great about the shower was that the knob to turn on is in the back of the shower so you don't get wet turning it on.  Design and decor are Cardinals themed which is a nice touch. The 2nd floor open air patio is great for lounging and the Clark and Bourbon is really good for food and drinks. They have a huge selection of Bourbon, so enjoy and the Wings were phenomenal. Parking is $30/night so be prepared for that. 
I wanted to give a 5, but a few things bothered me.
1) signs say no smoking within 25ft of the door, but when we lit cigars more than enough distance away, we were told to put them out and that the signs should say no smoking. 2) there isn't a place for guest to lounge and socialize after hours. The 2nd floor open patio closes at 11:30p and we were eating pizza late after drinks and had no where to sit, eat and socialize. For the price of this hotel, guest should have somewhere to do this.  3) There was also one night when the hotel staff said it was OK to sit by the fireplace section in the lobby and finish cocktails, but then the police officer made us leave. Everyone needs to be on the same page. 4) hotel requires 2 night stay on Cardinals home game days, so plan your Staycation accordingly.

The service was friendly and I want to say a special thank you to Ray in the valley and parking department. He carried our luggage up and pointed us in the direction of the aquarium which we had no idea how to walk to with all the construction going on. The only negative is we were confused with the complimentary wine offered at 5. Not sure what was going on as the lady kept moving the wine station by the elevator, only had 2 bottle out (1 white and 1 red - the red was really good) but if she poured the last bit to the people in front of you she would have to leave the station and go to the store room to get only 1 other bottle. Seems like there could be a better system in place. Also we weren't sure what time it ended as we were sitting in the lob and the service seemed to be over at 5:42pm.

I was an in-touch member since 2005 ( and then a karma member and then for some reason now it's an IHG affiliate) I have chosen kimpton for all traveling ( the Rouge, the Carlyle and the Monaco in DC, the Lorien in Alexandria, the Palomar several times in Chicago and the Brice in Savannah ) and I have never been disappointed. Lately my traveling has only taken me to New Orleans and there was no kimpton ( until recently) so I stayed in some other fine resorts but was so anxious to book the Fontanot.
Not sure if it is because of COVID or because of the IHG Affiliation, but this stay was sub par,
The room itself was fine-nothing special the bathroom could have used a heat lamp as it was drafty in the shower. The ""raid the mini bar"" perk is no longer an option-but even if it was I was told that since I was downgraded to 'club level status"" I would not have been eligible for that. There is s bicycle in the lobby that boasts it's yours to borrow but there is only one as the other is in for repairs-so my husband and I were disappointed that we could not take a ride together.
Finally, my son was in town for the week and WHILE II was on the phone making his reservation the room rate I was quoted became no longer available so I was offered a double queen room for him at $50 more per night- I made his reservation at a neighboring hotel for less $ and it proved to be the superior property. And parking at his resort was $20 per night compared to the $45 at kimpton :-(

I have stayed at many hotels, both for personal and business travel. Some have been less than desirable but I was able to make it work. However, I must say that this was the most disgusting experience I have ever had!

First, the location was not the cleanest and did not look as welcoming as the advertised pictures. The exterior of the building was not well maintained. The pool was not operational nor was the fitness center. The elevator was not working so I had to lug my bags upstairs to the second floor. The stairwell was sticky and I was hesitant to touch the rails. There was no air conditioning in the hallway...in August! Then, the key cards did not work. Had to call the front desk to come and open the door with the master key for the entire weekend!

The  hotel guests seemed like they are experiencing hard times. I was a bit concerned for my safety especially since the side doors remained unlocked all night. You never knew who night be roaming the halls.

Next, let's talk about the room. It appeared clean enough all things considered. However, there were missing pillowcases, the sleeper sofa was sunken, and there was a dip in the middle of the king-sized bed. Definitely not luxurious by any means. Plus, there were no towels and the front desk staff acted like they were being imposed upon to provide them. SMH!

The kicker happened Saturday night. I was lying in bed watching TV and heard all this rustling. I thought perhaps it was the air conditioning rustling the plastic bags sitting on the coffee table. NOPE! It was a MOUSE digging in the plastic garbage bag I had left on the floor after I had eaten because there was no garbage can in the room. OMG!

I called the front desk several times while the mouse dug around in the bag quite contentedly. When the hotel staff eventually arrived, they said ""We had been doing so well [with the mice]!"" And, of course, by that time, the mouse was nowhere to be seen. They said they would see what they could do and sent maintenance who said they could put out traps. I was like NO! I am not staying in a room with mouse traps.

I packed up my stuff and was prepared to sleep in my car if needed. ""Fortunately"" they were able to put me in another room for the night. I could not wait to get out of that place!

BOTTOM-LINE - It's a hard NO for me! The rooms cost too much to have to put up with these conditions. Your money would be better spent at another establishment!",2021-08-16 16:45:47 UTC,1,0,0,0,ZE0YHw9EqFmk2XpJIrhbDg

What a way to come into STL, with a view of Busch Stadium, the Arch, and a Nelly concert setting up outside our window. I'm just surprised they didn't have T-Ravs and Budweisers waiting for us.. 

Obviously with ""Live!"" in the name, it's going to be a bit livelier than some locations. For instance, I once stayed at the Union Station hotel around the holidays and it was eerily quiet around it, with very few restaurants around and Mariah Carey Christmas music echoing through the empty space. 

Live by Loew's is in Ballpark Village, similar to KC's Power & Light District, and it's a manufactured district for restaurants, nightlife and occasional concerts. We had no idea Nelly was doing a Tuesday night birthday bash, and I was thinking two thoughts. One, this is sweet! And two, would keep me up all night?...

I guess we're supposed to put the washcloth in there. Now, the microwave it wasn't working, so I put the plug-in lights in the room and began to Blink off and on. I held the plug-in; it began 2 sparked. I just pulled the plug out. So that's four. My wife and I were settled in; we didn't feel like moving. I waited until the next morning, showing the manager what was wrong with the room and that it should not have been handed out. Nobody inspected this room. I talked to the manager and he could say I'm sorry that's it. Our apologies for Easy out for him. I paid $200 for this room. I am not pleased and will never return there again. I showed him the pictures. He could care less. I called the Wyndham Corporation customer complaints oh, somebody took my report then and said somebody will call me this week. We'll see what will happen. But with all the other things the microwave with the most dangerous thing at all that could have caused the fire.",2022-01-02 22:47:32 UTC,2,0,0,0,T0mJdqmoNhigsQHJ1Gr08w

I had to drive another 25 miles with my broken leg find my own accommodations at another Best Western and pays $50 more than the price of my originally booked room.

We chose TownePlace Suites Tampa North/I-75 Fletcher because we were moving my daughter to Tampa and she had a dog.

We checked into room 107. Room 107 reeked of dogs - on the furniture and bed. The back of the room door was scratched by dogs. We were moved to room 304. Room 304 smelled of dogs, but not as severe. The curtains were tattered and torn and the furniture was filthy (see photos). The rugs were dirty. We found animal excrement in the bathroom behind the door.

On Tuesday, June 29th we requested the property's ""Tidy Service"" (clean towels and empty trash) and never received it.

She checked me in quickly. Luckily I was staying in the main building.  On the way to the elevator, I noticed the fitness room. It's very tiny but if you want a basic workout with weights, it'll do the job. When I walked into the elevator to take it up to the second floor, there were crumbs and debris on the floor. I thought to myself ""Oh, boy!"" My concerns were abaited when I entered the room. All the rooms here are suites with a small kitchenette, a couch and chair, ample desk, nice 5 closet, and a modern bathroom.  The first thing I do is check for signs for bed bugs. I was happy to see that they put a bed bug liner on the mattress and there were no signs of any bed bugs.  The room was clean.  There were some flaws. I noticed chipped, peeling paint on the baseboards and walls. But again, the room was clean. 

The hotel is centrally located in North Tampa about a mile from I-75.

We have stayed at this historic hotel in the past when older reviews indicated this space had a fabulous staff and maintained a small luxury historical hotel in the heart of the French Quarter. 

The Sonderization of this hotel is a travesty. There is not a single solitary person who is staffed at the building. If you have any problem with anything with your room, you must use an App that might or might not work and it takes hours to get a reply. There is no local number to call for any type of assistance. We finally got call center number in the room. Need additional toilet paper, you call a call center or use the app. Your toilet is clogged? App or call the call center. Considering the age of the building, having no staff is detrimental to the building itself, outside of being unacceptable customer service for a place that is relying on years of great reviews focused on service.

Everyone we saw in the hotel had pretty much the same experience and was disappointed. Each room had a single solitary tiny bathroom trash can. There is no housecleaning service so no trash is picked up until you check out. This might help explain the huge roaches we saw upon check-in.  The patio flowers are dying because they aren't watered or cared for. There wasn't even a plastic cup for brushing one's teeth.

The website touts the bar/lounge, which has nothing to do with the hotel, which the bar employees are quick to mention. They lease space for the bar. (It's a good place to grab a specialty cocktail.) 

The Sonderization of this formerly fabulous small hotel has transformed it into an expensive, uncared for hostel. If Sonder's 27-year-old CEO thinks this is the future of the hotel experience, he needs to clearly state this at each of the properties instead of marketing a bait and switch of his Sonders.",2021-07-03 13:52:08 UTC,1,0,0,4,JyYCoU3JA04Y4D8NXctBHA

My friend and I stayed in a 2 bedroom suite which is off the courtyard. The room had brick walls which were crumbling every day and on every surface around the room to include the box with the open coffee filters. It would land on me, the bed, and I even brought quiet a bit of grit home with me. At no point could we walk barefoot in this room.
Our room runs the length of the hotel courtyard which is seating for the hotel bar. Needless to say, it gets noisy once the bar opens (great drinks at the bar though). On the other side of the rear courtyard wall and my wall back is Court of Two Sisters. During brunch, the jazz band sounded like they were in my bedroom from 9 am till they finished! As far as the restaurant, you hear all their business from their opening to closing routines. There are also other bars that back up to the courtyard and their noise carries over. Needless to say, YOU WILL NOT SLEEP ON THIS TRIP.
The bathroom is another annoyance. There is not storage space save for a small metal storage tower that is directly in front of the towel hooks. If you pull it out to make room for your towel on the towel hooks, this tower is even more in your way. Plus, the shower is open so the tower gets wet (imagine everyone before you having their shower water bounce onto this tower - doubt they are cleaning it). Everything gets wet from steam and shower spray. EVERYTHING!  Even the ""far"" wall.
Small note, they have an automatic system for watering their plants. One of these is over the door into the room. You will have to walk through a shower to get in or out when it's going off. It also creates a puddle so your shoes/feet will get wet. Not well planned out.
For the rooms in the house, I can only imagine the inconvenience of them. Room 1 has street noise, front door slamming noise, is in the lobby, and noise from the rest of the patrons getting to the courtyard and bar. The other rooms are up a tall, narrow set of stairs. Good luck with your bags.

(In transparency, I don't know about the hiring practices of Conquistador- the previous statement is my hunch based on my experience). 

Firstly, if you look at my other reviews, I don't typically actively look for reasons to say a hotel room is bad. I feel like some reviewers walk into a room and check every inch of the floor for a single hair and then photograph it. I look passed those small problems - unless there are too many to list. 

In this case there are too many items to ignore: 

1. The front desk seems to have lots of staff, but it is hit or miss on if they will be helpful or not. 

2. This resort requires lots of walking - typical and not a big deal for a resort. But, when we called the front desk to ask about bellhop services to take our luggage out upon the end of our stay the exact words were, ""Take it out the same way you brought it in.""  Hmm, seems a little less than sympathetic for a place that had those services pre-COVID and costs $320ish a night pre-resort fee. (Did those bellhops get laid off? Isn't it about time to figure out how to bring them back?) 

3. There is no longer any room service. It is April 2021, isn't it about time they figure out how to make a resort work efficiently including room service? (Did those food service workers get laid off?) 

4. The room had various items wrong. The toilet paper holder fell off the wall. The bathroom door knob didn't close / work. The refrigerator interior freezer door was broken off. Stains all over the carpet. The pool was super crowded. If they are concerned enough about COVID to not offer room service or bellhop services - why is the pool packed? I am not exaggerating - at 4:00 on Saturday afternoon you could not find 2 open reclining chairs next to one another. (Hence, my commentary previously on how some businesses have found a way to use COVID to save / make money). 

On some positive notes - the most visible staff at the resort were housekeeping, they are singlehandedly ensuring patrons have a good stay. They are making sure towels are available and delivered. They are around the rooms to refill any items and take trash away. And they are checking on the comfort of the guests. All from outside the room, since they are not cleaning rooms during the stay due to COVID - which is totally understandable considering their role. 

The king size casita itself - had my above list of items been addressed - would have been awesome. It included a large size bedroom, living room, and kitchen. There were 2 big screen TVs - one in the bedroom, one in the living room. Other highlights - a fireplace, 2 refrigerators, coffee maker, a nice size closet, great windows, nice temperature controls. 

I have stayed at the Conquistador in 2010 pre-COVID and had an incredible experience. After my
latest visit I will opt for a different resort next time I vacation in Tucson.",2021-04-06 15:40:34 UTC,2,1,1,8,vL7rW2yMUhYdmXib5TRVbw

We have stayed at the Lowe's Ventana Canyon, Westward Look, Omni. We checked in at the El Conquistador and the lobby and front of building were excellent. However, apparently our advertised special was for a section of the building that had obviously not been refurbished. 
The very back building of the property looked like a completely different hotel - old, not maintained, not nicely landscaped, bits of trash and cigarette butts on the walkways/elevator. 
Our room was also tired, old, poorly decorated. 
We also discovered the likely reason for the last minute room special: the entire hotel was taken over by a PROM.....and everything you can imagine that goes along with that. When returning from dinner, the parking situation was ridiculous and after a lengthy search we ended up about 2-3 blocks from the building our room was in.  We just packed up and left the next morning - without attempting to eat brunch. Wouldn't stay here again at any price.",2021-02-10 19:31:38 UTC,2,0,0,2,D_-Nies6Ea1UhmrqwV6ojQ

Having visited many resorts before, the El Conquistador service and staff just keep getting better! Many staff promotions since summer has only made this place better. 
Rob, former bellman, now running the front desk, is the main man for all your resort needs. Valet, bags to your upgraded room, robes/slippers awaiting your arrival and their signature prickly pear cactus margarita is only the tip of the ice berg when it comes to the service you will receive. 
Iliana, also at the front desk, is a delight to communicate with making anything possible! She always greets with a smile, amazing attitude and rocks the most sought after dazzling diamond encrusted masks in the valley. She is professional while making you feel at home and well taken care of. 
Jake, pool manager, is energetic, anticipating your every need (because pool pampering is definitely a plus here)  all while maintaining a spotless deck, perfectly placed shaded loungers and many large cozy family fire pits placed nicely around the property overlooking the pool. Slide, jacuzzi, cold plunge and splash area for younger guests are all nearby the main pool area and offers something for everyone. 
Hungry? Hit up Kelson at the pool bar/cafe for drinks, smoothies, burgers, hot dogs, quesadillas, chips and more! Conversate, watch the game and grab a bite with Kelson. Great attitude and fun to hang with. He'll make you smile, guaranteed. 
No resort is complete without a spa day! Josie is a pro at setting up all your pampering needs! Lunch, champagne, day packages are her expertise all while ensuring your experience is top notch at Spawell. Located at the entrance of the resort, this relaxing, adult only breathtaking and serene environment boasts  amazing aromas, steam room, heated pool, meditation salt room with robes and towels that will melt you like butter. Massage tables are warmed and massages by Anita (services men and women) are epic. Anita, a recent addition to Spawell since May, has experience unrivaled by anyone at the spa. Need an epic facial? Ask for Kristie. 
Heading out for golf or just need help with luggage? Hassan is waiting to give you the royal treatment you deserve! You won't be lifting a finger with Hassan around! I was treated like a Queen from having doors opened and a familiar face excited to greet me. My bags were waiting in my room and my keys, wristbands, menus, activity schedule, ice and waters were already taken care of by the time I got to my room. Hassan steps up to deliver epic customer service wherever needed and looks sharp while doing it. You'll find him among the hardest working staff here all while strutting those unmistakable Armani pants! 
Weddings, parties, golf, spa days, date nights, weekend with the parents and kids....the El Conquistador does it all with flair. I'm addicted and will be a loyal ""Resort Queen"" for years to come.

To start, I cannot stress how beautiful this place is. From the well-maintained grounds, to the large, open lobby with tasteful southwestern decor, to the pool area, to the stunning views of the Catalinas, this place earns a 5/5 for aesthetics alone. It's worth a visit just to see this place. 

In addition, the restaurant Epazote is a real gem. I have dined there many times and am always happy with the food, the service, and the unbeatable view.  While I didn't dine here during this stay, it looked like the restaurant t was doing a steady business, which I was really glad to see. 

My brother and my sister-in-law held a party in the Sundance room to celebrate their recent marriage and the hotel did an excellent job executing this. The party was well
organized with friendly, professional staff,delicious appetizers, and good bar service.

With this being said, there is room for improvement. Check-in was an unnecessarily  complex process. Not only do they give you about 15 pieces of paper, the process was also tinged with sexism. My mom made the room reservations for her and my dad and for my husband and me, and despite making the reservations herself and putting them on her credit card, it was my dad--the man--who had to come to the front desk and show his ID in order for my mom to check into her room. Same thing for my husband and our room. It made absolutely no sense. 

In addition, some of the events that were advertised as happening never occurred. The schedule said there would be trivia at 5 in the lobby bar. Gus, who checked us in, said we should definitely check it out, but upon arriving to the bar, there was no trivia to be found. 

Finally, while our room was very nice with absolutely stunning views of the mountains, the bed was horrible. I'm probably being extra harsh here because I'm 9 months pregnant, but I've never slept on a softer mattress. I found it nearly impossible to roll over. That on top of the super heavy comforter and the lack of a fitted sheet on the bottom made me have a pretty miserable night of sleep. However if you like insanely soft beds that feel like you're sinking into a vat of butter, then this is your place!  

I didn't get to enjoy the pool, but my husband loved it, so if I come back, I would love to enjoy that amenity. 

Overall, this place is beautiful and with some minor tweaks, it would easily be 5 stars in my book.",2021-06-28 22:43:38 UTC,4,3,1,4,t009tI2gqPSAvu1LbIJ4zg

It is a ""con"" job...that's for sure!! My girlfriend and I, both disabled, had the most stressful spa getaway weekend of our lives! I am fighting numerous health issues including seven autoimmune disorders and extremely brittle diabetes as a necrotizing pancreatitis survivor. It is difficult for me to travel because of my many health issues and constant concern with how I will receive meals. I was delighted to be able to make these plans after 2 years involving lengthy hospital stays (to celebrate just being alive) but was in tears by the end of my weekend....

NOTE: DO NOT MISS THE SPA. Lydia is phenomenal. But save yourself the headache, book through Groupon, and stay at a Motel 6 if you want better hotel mgmt and service. The grounds are gorgeous but this is Tucson... that's par for the course for these resorts! I can look at mountains and beautiful grounds at home.

1). I booked TWO Spa packages for 2 nights which included charcuterie boards and souvenir size champagne (though neither of us drink). They gave us one board and 1 bottle of champagne. We had to ask for crackers because they forgot (even though a cheeseball was included). When I inquired about the 2nd board on Saturday, they had a hostess call to tell us they would not be sending it and made a reference to the idea we were trying to overindulge in the alcohol. No, we were more interested in the charcuterie board before our spa appt because we were starving.

2. This is not an ADA or handicapped friendly environment. There is A LOT of walking to get to rooms, the lobby, spa, etc. I was told my requests to be placed near an elevator and other accommodations would only be honored if we booked an accessible room. When I contacted Hilton Cus Svr, the front desk lied to Hilton and said they couldn't switch rooms because they were totally booked. There was ONE wedding booked on Saturday and it was completely dead on Sunday.

3) There is ONE restaurant open on the premises and it only serves rooms on Friday and Saturday between 5-9PM. Everything else had to be picked up and we would have had to drive all around 3 buildings to get to the restaurant near the lobby (I have mobility issues due to chronic lung conditions that cause extreme fatigue.) They didn't care.

4) A breakfast was to be included but no one cared to inform us of where it would be held. When I contacted the Front Desk (Augustine), I was told I could find a copy of the breakfast menu on the website.. No... only broken links there. He argued with me and finally someone came up and threw a menu on the floor. Hilton Cus Svc asked if I asked about this. No, I did not because in all of my years of traveling (US and Int'l), especially for spa getaways and secret shoppings, I have NEVER had to ask for amenities that were supposed to be included in the overall package. My bad.

5) The dinner meal offerings were meager and of a bar/grill nature...many of which I cannot consume. We tried Door Dashing it...

6) Door Dasher was not allowed to deliver food to the room...so I had to retrieve my Sat breakfast delivery from the lobby. Even though I drove, it was stone cold.... cold eggs.... great.

7) I was advised by the front desk and Hilton CS to make my own delivery arrangements closer to the room. Ok... I did....I told him I would meet him outside our gate.

8) The Door Dasher was stopped driving in the parking lot and told to leave it at the front desk. No one informed me. By the time I got to the lobby, $90 meal...stone cold. 

9) Do you know what it is like to have low blood sugar? On vacation? Because you cannot get a secure meal plan????

10) The rooms were musty; some areas could benefit from more attention. There was hair on the bathroom floor. No vent in the bathroom. The toilet seat broke from regular use (cheap, cheap plastic...my hubby is a plumbing professional... I know cheap when I see it.) Cheap, cheap bathroom amenities (you'd think they would have provided spa product samples. Who does the marketing?)

11) I called Hilton Cus Svc 4 times during my stay. I was given a case number on my last contact and told I would hear from someone in 3 days (even the email said so). Day 4, I called and was told I had to wait 3-5 days. I called on day 7 and was finally offered some options to make up for the poor service... but I refuse to take chances on a $1000 hotel booking ever again. Hilton is usually an exceptionally well run organization but this place is dragging their name through the mud!!

12) The wifi is HORRIBLE!! Not for business purposes!!

13) Don't take my word for it, read MANY of the other reviews which, I see, mgmt didn't care to respond to.  I sure should have.

Bottom line... I understand pandemic difficulties but nasty and disrespectful attitudes by staff have nothing to do with that. If you charge pre-pandemic prices and resort fees, you should provide pre-pandemic service.",2021-09-28 01:32:32 UTC,1,0,0,3,RRqyzKLVmuaplezMnJ30rA

It feels like you are right under the Catalina Mountains at this resort. From the pool and outdoor restaurant seating, you can just sit back and take it in. I'd highly recommend this place for the views alone. 

The pool:
It got a bit crowded on a Saturday afternoon, but the atmosphere was very friendly. There was a nice mixture of generations drinking and laughing and having fun. You won't feel overly young or overly old here. There was also a DJ, and some sort of poolside hype person that would occasionally play a game or have a little contest between some of the kids at the pool. I'd argue things were a little too kid-centric during these times, but you could just ignore it if you wanted to. There is also a very nice hot tub and cold plunge tub isolated from the rest of the pool--this is where the best views are.

The service:
Checking in seemed overly complicated. Don't expect a simple process. That said, the pool service was exceptional. The bartenders are so nice, and there was a poolside server--Joey--who better be running this place some day. He was taking orders left and right, never wrote anything down, and was power walking everything to everyone with an efficiency somehow not affected by the sun and 100+ degree temperatures. He was very polite too, even when one friend in our group got a little rowdy after one too many drinks. He also got us drink deals we weren't aware of. Joey is the star of this resort. 

The rooms:
The rooms are nice. The bathroom was spacious, and we had a great view of the Catalinas. My wife, who's 9-months pregnant, complained about the beds being too soft and the shower water pressure being too hard. But again, she's pregnant, so, you know...

Now with the negatives.....
First off, I'll say the reason I'm writing this is because it's been 13 days and I've yet to receive my deposit back. I booked and paid through a third party and was just told that they didn't realize it, even though the front desk clerk knew good and well i did. Also I have yet to be able to speak with a manager or anyone that can actually help me there. So they are just holding onto my 850$ for what almost two weeks now. Not good!!

Also will say make sure to pack your hiking shoes if your staying in the casitas, it's a trek! The hotel does provide transport when they are available, but just keep that in mind. Another thing that was a huge deal for us when we got into our room the AC was off. Not breaking any news here but it's a little hot in AZ in June! It had to be atleast 105-110 in the room, and mind you we were traveling with a small toddler child, that and the room had crumbs all over the table and just looked like it hadn't been cleaned at all, only the bed made, guess covid is over. It startled my girlfriend so much that she wanted me to call the front desk to make sure we hadn't walked into the wrong room, or someone else's room. To me it looked like it might have been used as a maid and staff break room, they had lunch at the table and went back to work. But definitely not up to snuff and shouldn't happen at a resort like this. The front desk sent someone out, he looked a little surprised as well, so maybe a one off type of thing. But told us he would report back and let them know and we would get ""taken care of"" whatever that means.

With all this said I'm not the type that likes to slander any business and the hard working individuals that come together as a team, put in the work to provide us with these nice resorts. But business shouldn't be handled in this fashion either. We are a blue collar, middle class family and $850 just floating around for no good reason for 14 days and counting is a big deal to us. Will I recommend this place? I'll wait and see what if anything will be done here and if i ever get my money back. The place was nice like i said, and really could be a spot we continue to visit, just had some pretty major issues that will probably keep us from ever going back. 

If you already have paid and booked this resort, I would probably recommend the main hotel portion, that would be a better option even though the rooms might be smaller. And definitely make sure your only paying for the deposits (I asked twice and the guy assured me I was giving an $800 hold) if you already paid with a third party reservation agency! Just my two cents.

However, when you see the name Hilton and Resort in the same name and pay what they're asking for a room or suite here, you'd expect better.
The hallway carpets leading to the rooms are filthy. My feet inched just looking at them. The room was basic and the fridge was room temp. The fan in the bathroom didn't work at all, the bathroom didn't lock and the sheets can be a lot softer...my wife added that.

We live in Tucson but I took my wife here for a weekend away from the kids for her birthday.

We were told by the snarky front desk person that she would follow up and find out what happened so it doesn't happen again.. that's fine for the Hilton, but how does that help me? Now her tone starts to move more to the sassy side when she says since I don't like her solution then what do I suggest? Really? Who is in charge of customer service? How about move me to another room? How about a complimentary wine and appetizer at the bar while your staff fixes the problem? Maybe a $100 credit at the spa? Free round of Golf? How about comping the room? Clearly none of these ideas even entered her customer service sphere .... I've stayed in several hotels since COVID and this is by far the worst experience.

We learned about the Trinity (onion, celery and bell pepper) and how to make a proper roux. She talked about how to substitute and swap out ingredients. It was quite fun 

The best part is that you get to eat whatever is being cooked. The day I went, the menu was corn and crab bisque, shrimp etouffe and pralines. We left with full tummies and smiles.

But honestly, the best part of the class was Harriet herself. I swear, the people of the South are the most hospitable and friendly I've ever met while on vacation.  She even wrote a cookbook with a friend, which is sold in the cooking store gift shop.

What an experience!  Top notch date idea for anyone looking to do something a little different with their partner.

This was my first time attending a class at New Orleans school of cooking and I was so impressed.  The hands-on class cost $145 each, which is pretty hefty but when you factor in the amount of time you are getting with the chef and their knowledge, plus the quality of the food, and the endless mimosas/bloody Mary's...it is well worth it.  Luckily for me this was a gift but I'd be more than willing to pay another $145 for another experience.   The hands-on class was small with only 8 people (I think it's a max of 10) and we had a very incredible chef that was full of stories about the history of the food and city.  After sitting down and listening to our chef for a bit, we got our first drinks and the bloody Mary was pretty good!  They also had a selection of local beers you could pick instead.  Didn't try the mimosa but it looked pretty standard.  

The food that we made was so worth it.  We started by getting the beef grillades going, and then worked on the corn and crab bisque while the beef was braising.  The soap was fantastic and everyone there ended up getting seconds.  We also got some fresh french bread at the table with the soup.  After finishing the soup, we went back to the table to finish the grillades and start on the cheese grits.  Pretty easy to put both dishes together (with the help of the chef).  Even though everyone was stuffed by the time they finished the beef grillades, the desert needed to be made and everyone had room.  We made banana foster for dessert, which was a first for me. It was  surprisingly easy to put together, and it is definitely something we will start making at home.

I can't recommend this enough.  As a date night idea or something to take your family to while they are if town, or just a chance to learn about creole/Cajun cooking this class is perfect for you.

We typically schedule a waking food tour when we go out of town and this was a great alternate. I'd suggest going to the school in person to book the class and check on availability so it's easier to make changes and adjustments. There is a limited window (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday) that they have the demonstrations. Check in was simple. You should try to be three at least 10 mins before your start time. They called your name and seat you by party. They also provide recipe cards/printouts so you can make the dishes at home. I'm glad they give you pen and paper because you will be writing down the tips and tricks the chef uses when they make their dishes. We had Chef Cindy. She's a pleasure to listen to and follow. I really liked how the room had a large mirror hanging from
The ceiling so you can see what's happening on the stove and countertops. I'm a visual person so this is very helpful. Everything tasted delicious and there was plenty to go around.

There were eight of us and when we called at 9 o'clock - the VCMail said if you're within 10 minutes don't worry you will not be considered late. We arrived three minutes late and were told sorry. 

At this point, we think there wasn't even a tour and that we completely got jacked.

The staff were friendly, but this was not a clean hotel. I wish I had packed gloves to touch the elevator buttons. In our room, several surfaces were sticky and had crumbs scatteredacross them, there were brown splatters on the wall above one of the lamps, the carpets had white spill marks (I don't even want to know), there were sticky/shiny spots on the couch, and I didn't want to touch the door handles or lamp switches. Because this was a crash pad for a night, and the sheets *looked* clean, we decided to stay, but I will never be staying in an Oyo again. 

Less concerning to me, but also of note: 
- the furnishings and decor were unkempt and shabby - almost every piece of furniture throughout the building was chipped, wallpaper was torn, and I really didn't want to sit on anything upholstered. 
- parking is either $25 through the hotel, or $8.75 per day in the lot behind the hotel. If you do the lot behind, make sure to either use the website (where you can pay ahead) or plan to go out to the kiosk at midnight, as the ""day rate"" is only available through that. We ended up paying about $27 to park overnight, and had to set an alarm for midnight because the options weren't straightforward at the get go. Also, the hotel tried to charge us for their parking, despite us not using it, so we will be checking our account to make sure they took that charge off. 
- no coffee. Anywhere in the hotel. 
- signs (and I believe the website) indicated that there was a hotel bar and a sundeck with lounge furniture and tables. The hotel bar has apparently been closed for over a year. The sundeck is there, but looks to be under construction (?), as it's dirty and there's very limited furniture which, again, was dirty. 
- the bath towels were basically sandpaper. I recommend patting down rather than rubbing.

After spending some time in New Orleans recently, I had very low expectations of the tour led by St. Louis Paranormal Research Society because I had just seen so many tourist trap style tours in the French Quarter.

Well my expectations were buried 6-feet below ground because the St. Louis Paranormal Research Society led one of the most incredibly engaging tours I've ever had the pleasure of participating in. And while excursions like this are often reserved for vacations, I cannot suggest this tour enough to St. Louis locals. 

The experience began in the St. Louis Paranormal Research Society brick & mortar location which is actually in one of the Lemp Brewery buildings. The waiting area truly sets the stage for a spooky experience! There are creepy antiques and photos to look at. There is a seance room with candles and Ouija boards that I was even kind of uncomfortable looking into because it had such an intense vibe. The St. Louis Paranormal Research Society also had a small retail area full of stones and charms for purchase. 

Our tour guide Mark is an actual paranormal investigator and you could tell he really knew what he was talking about. From the moment he started talking I knew that this was nothing like the touristy ghost tours in other cities that were meant to grab as much cash with as little effort as possible. From the stories he told you could tell that he's very passionate about the work he does. What I found so interesting was the amount of historical knowledge he shared. Facts about the Lemp family and things I didn't know about the neighborhood. He was a dynamic and entertaining tour guide who kept my attention for the entire duration of the experience. The best part about his tour was the use of a tablet to show archival photos of the buildings we were looking at during the tour. It made it that much creepier to see photos of apparitions and oddities while we were standing in the exact locations that they were taken.

I'm terrible at reading details before I sign up for things, so I was incredibly surprised and pleased that we actually got to go inside the Lemp brewery! I'm sure it said somewhere in the description of the tour, but it was a treat when Mark unlocked an entrance to the old brewery I was overtaken by pure excitement. But also apprehension because the austere building has such a creepy presence in the neighborhood. 

I don't want to give too much away about the tour because my written words cannot pay the experience the due that is deserved. If you're visiting St. Louis, or just want to learn more about the history of one of the oldest neighborhoods in the city, book a ticket for a tour with St. Louis Paranormal Research Society. And pray that you can sleep after. I know I couldn't.",2021-08-19 23:18:14 UTC,5,4,2,6,JhLtQI28uttgPWdNfyDNIQ

If I could give this place a 0 I would.... Being that I have been coming here since 2000 and have really experienced TERROR BEHIND THE WALLS YOU HAVE TOTALLY RUINED THE GREATEST HAUNT EVER!! Let's see..
No fun on the line - remember the scary guy with the rat chasing and scaring people on the line GONE
Gone is the excitement 
Gone are the gargoyles Carson and Frank who should be OUTSIDE IN FRONT WHERE THEY BELONG
Gone is the smear of blood on your face (fake)
Gone is the neon ring around your neck
Gone is being grabbed from your group
Gone are the scary ghoul guards outside on the line
What is this crap you can sit outside and have s'more 
I'm not here for a campout!!!!
Gone are the awesome prison dancers  - their makeup alone was AWESOME 
Gone is the photo you'd take upon entering and a zombie or ghoul would jump and pop in the photo 
Do you really want to waste your time here and who cares about a free drink. That's what bars are for. I'm not here for this or giant lollipop sticks
What a TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT THIS WAS!!!!! For those of us that have been going since 2020 you know exactly what I mean....this has been a 20yr tradition and sadly we won't be returning till TBTW RETURNS.....
To make b matters worse we were not allowed to enter the last attraction because there were closing it wasn't even 11pm yet and we almost didn't get our photo cause the guy was just a jerk

About 5-10 minutes for each one. I then thought we were at the VIP bar part but it was a different beer garden/lounge where they wanted you to pay for drinks. No thank you. 

We then got to the s'mores area which looked cool. I thought they would be included since we got the VIP but no they were $4 each. It didn't have any graham cracker either it was just the marshmallow and it was stuffed with either an Oreo, peanut butter cup, or plain? They should have been like $1 I thought. It drips all over the place too when you try to eat it so half if it either dripped on the floor or  napkin. They should have gave you paper plates or something to eat with. 

I was looking for the gargoyle gardens to see the dance performance- people dressed as skeletons do it every half hour. It was very cool- and the dancers come up to you and dance with you too in between performances which was fun. 

The bloodline lounge was disappointing. It was just some tables outside , it wasn't really a lounge. And you only get a choice of Cabernet wine, soda, or some vodka cranberry mix, or some kind of food. They give you the smallest amount too . My friend wanted to get some water and they were gonna make her use her drink voucher on it so she said forget it. Then I saw someone else with some different drink with a syringe shot attached. I think they said they knew the bartender, so I guess you get special treatment if you know someone there. 

We finally got to the Speakeasy at Al Capone's cell. The drinks that were included were disappointing again. The choices were beer, seltzers, wine, or soda. Kind of misleading because when I hear Speakeasy I think of cocktails. I know they can't go all out and make complicated cocktails with a ton of ingredients. But they could of at least had some pre made cocktails to choose from. Like the other bar that wasn't included with the VIP had some pumpkin bourbon cocktail that seemed good - why couldn't we have gotten that? 

We had fun inside the Speakeasy section though. They had different cells that were furnished with decor from the 1920s that you could go in and sit down and have a drink so that was cool. They had someone reading tarot cards In one of the other cells. And someone was playing blackjack with people in another cell. The workers were dressed in 1920s costumes too. 

Overall I'm glad we went and we had fun. But I don't know if it's worth the price- we won't go back if it's there another year.",2021-10-16 18:28:17 UTC,2,0,0,0,9tOwB6Y17TJEbVFC5HGETw

I'm new to Boise, so I took advantage of a special that Airport Inn advertised. Stay & pay for 4 nights @$500+ tax and receive a 7 day stay. So I stayed 7 and renewed another 7 days. 

So in theory this was supposed to give me peace of mind as I look for permanent housing. Instead it's been a banking nightmare. I was over charged $5300+ on top of my 2 7 day weekly specials. 

This was brought to their attention on 8/30/21 when I discovered it, and it still hasn't been retified as of 9/1/21. Extra calls have been made about this.

My advice to anyone considering staying here, is to check the activity on your credit or debit card as soon as possible, so that it can be addressed immediately. Also contact and alert your bank as to what is going on with your account.

If this review gives you concern, then I have been effective in sharing my experience. The management claim it's a computer/system glitch. Yes no kidding about that.

Also every other ""attraction"" is actually just food and drinks for you to spend money on overpriced things. There is no fear factor at all and there's even a safe word to get the 4 actors to stop trying to scare you. Like why are you at a haunted attraction if you need a safe word. No thanks. 
Also don't buy the VIP pass. The vampire lounge was the most pathetic thing I've ever walked by, there was 1 actor who was just leaning on a fence so I don't know how that was labeled scary. I don't know about al capones cell.

The desk employee was very polite and friendly which I appreciated, but then we got to our room and it too smelled of smoke.  My son is sensitive to that due to some heart issues he was born with, so we had to find someplace else.  The employee again was extremely polite in helping us check out.  When we got to the new hotel, we realized we were missing a bag.  We called this place to see if someone could check the room for us, and after a 30 second hold we were told the room had no bag in it.  (Our room was quite a ways from the lobby, no way it could've been checked that fast.)

The next morning we returned to see if our bag had been turned in, and the new desk employee looked us up and said we'd never been checked out the night before as we were told we had been, so our card had to be charged.  He then gave me a new room key to check for the bag, and sure enough it was there by the TV stand/dresser.  As nice as the employees were, I didn't love being lied to twice.  Not cool.  

Also, the rooms are trashed with damage and patched ceilings.  The key scanners at the exterior door handles hardly work.  This is a long term stay hotel so people have decorations in their windows and clearly live there.  The pool had caution tape up as a barrier, multiple people awkwardly smoking outside the rooms and staring at you as you carry your things to your room.  It just did not have a welcoming vibe to it at all and my kids were excited to swim, there's no way I would've taken them to the pool here with how dirty it was and all the people hanging around it smoking.

You really had us fooled when you were hyping up the event talking about how there was Live music! Dancers! A speakeasy to chill from all of the excitement! I think by live music, he was referring to the two guys who were banging on a metal trash can and one of those drum shaped cones you see at construction signs. And by dancers, he meant the people dancing to basic pop music wearing generic skeleton costumes you can buy at Target.

Biggest waste of $80 in my life! Yes, $80 (for VIP). For $80, you get to skip the lines so that you can go through less than 30 minutes worth of lame attractions faster and so you can have really basic drinks. Drink #1 was a vodka cranberry I could have made at home. There was no attempt to even give the drink a name that would match the spirit of Halloween. Literally just a ""vodka cranberry"". The second drink was a hard seltzer. The options were either that or a basic local beer.

On Halloween a couple days after going to this, I saw people walking down the street in the skeleton costumes the ""dancers"" were wearing and was filled with a combination of PTSD and anger over my wasted $80.

The only semi-cool thing was the speakeasy but really only because it was in former jail cells and because of some of the history of the jail that they shared. But I would have preferred to go to Eastern State on a normal day to get the full story.

There were a couple visually interesting and artistic attractions but nothing was even remotely scary or eerie. From what I've heard, Terror Behind the Walls was much better than this.

1. The queens only did 2 dances each. Out of the 1 1/2 hour ride 4 performances. I feel like at least 6 all together would have been nice! 1 at the start, middle and end. 

2. Your bus ride should include either a free or 1/2 off entry into play. We spent over $50 for the bus, my whole group was ready to go spend more money on drinks and queens. But the 15 entry fee on top of the $50 bus ride was a huge turn off. We went next to to tribe for a free entry.

Now the pros, the queens were fun! They interacted with us. They were fun when they were out and we actually saw them. The coolers on the bus. What a smart and awesome idea!

Parking can be a challenge so when they tell you to get there 45 minutes beforehand, do it if you aren't using Lyft or Uber! We lucked out and found a spot without issue plus, found all we needed to drink at the liquor store across the street!

Shockingly, it was a 2 week wait to be serviced. The appointment was scheduled and I was to receive a loaner car.

Upon dropping my car off, I was told there were no loaner cars, come back tomorrow and we should have one. I'm sorry, but a two week out appointment? Now they've disrupted my day and wasted my time ($). I was unable to make the following day. I immediately left and called PEP BOYS. 
When I told this story to PEP BOYS, they said we're happy to have your business. It's not my 1st disappointment with Hill Cadillac.

My family leased cars from Hill for many, many years (family business) 3 cars every 2 years. Not that anyone's counting. 

I really love the Lyriq! I won't be buying it from Hill. In fact, I'm turned off by Cadillac altogether from this experience. 

I'm accountable in my business. We're all accountable. Do you your Job Hill Cadillac


William H, 

While I can appreciate your attempt to stay ahead of your critics, let me add that if you need my assistance in managing your service department, I am available. I would've very simply checked the schedule first thing in the morning to see if Hill had enough loaner vehicles available to accommodate the days appointments. If that was not the case, I would have reached out to each customer who had an appointment scheduled and rescheduled their appointment for a day when Hill did have loaner cars and not interrupt their day and make them drive to the dealership to tell them, ""we're sorry we don't have loaner cars.""

They did have a small swimming pool and fitness center. Me and the kids took advantage of the pool for a bit. It did the trick we had fun. 

The area was solid. They had some decent food options in the area. A few of them shut down. Not sure if it from the covid pandemic or lack of successful business. But it seemed like a nice area.

With the Jays being exiled from Toronto I was eager to head down for a regular season game in Dunedin. I went to the Phillies game on 5/16 and had terrific seats behind the dugout. Even got a toss up at the end of the inning from Vladdy! The atmosphere here was pretty relaxed and definitely a fan friendly place to be. If only all regular season ballparks were like this. Tickets are sold in pods of two and you didn't have to keep a mask on while at your seats.

Had so much fun attending that I decided to drive back down the following weekend and attend a game on 5/23 against the Rays. This time we had seats at the West Jet seats in Right Field. Somehow it was all overtaken by Rays fans, well most of the ballpark. Rays fans are pretty clueless. You'd think that this was their first time at a ballgame. It was pretty annoying that there was no food out in right field. They closed off the walkway because of its proximity to the bullpen. So you have to walk through left field and go by home plate (main entrance to grab food). Yeah I didn't want to miss 2 innings so I stayed put. Thankfully I ate before the game. The food at TD Ballpark isn't spectacular so I highly suggest eating beforehand. Parking also ranges from $10-$20. You can park anywhere it's only a few minutes to walk.

I wanted to try Choice hotels on the recommendation of a good friend.
Our first stay was last weekend at Choices Frenchmen at 519, Ascend Hotel. This was a 3-day family vacation to celebrate my wife's birthday. The room was at the higher end of our budget but in a new location, we wanted to try. The Hotel room was fine, just starting to show some wear and only 6 parking spots on site. The cleanliness of the towels left a lot to be desired. Nothing like drying your back only to find an old mascara stain on the other side of the towel.
Night one we were woken at 4am by a party in the room above us. This went on for an hour or so. We couldn't go to the front office as there was no one covering the desk. This hotel management was new to me. So, I assumed that I could not reach anyone until the morning.
The Morning of day 2, I woke up to see that my car had been vandalized with 2 windows broken. The hotel employees were empathetic and helpful. Even called the police to start the report. Kind of ruined the day.  The parking lot was right behind the hotel and is where they send their guests to park. I would have thought they might have had a guard on duty. That was a wrong assumption.
Morning of day 3, woken by my car alarm as some had torn off the duct tape and cardboard repair made for the 10-hour drive back to Austin to gain access.

Most recently I rented a car from here to drive to Elko to attend a wedding. I made the reservation months in advance online (it seems to be very hard to get a rental if you are less than a week out from the date you need the vehicle). I requested to pick up the car on Friday at 8am and return the car on Monday. Online system would not let me return the car Sunday as the location is closed.
I arrived at the office at 8am and was promptly checked in. I was told the car would be ready shortly. The staff was nice, and I appreciate a clean vehicle (I also appreciate the extra sanitation due to COVID-19 including the extra Clorox wipes they leave for you in the car). However, it was over an hour before the car was ready. Not a huge deal as I was not on a set schedule, but disappointing to sit around for an hour. I don't claim to know how to run a car rental agency, but it seems to me that if you have a reservation on the books for the next day at 8am (when they open) then someone should assure the car is ready the night before. I know things happen that can mess up plans, but this was my only complaint.
They thanked me for my patience, we inspected the car, I signed the paperwork, and I was off. No issues with the car at all.
As an added bonus, I was able to return the car Sunday night by using the key drop box which was very convenient as I had to be to work on Monday at 7am (before Enterprise opens) which would have made returning the vehicle on Monday tough. Staff called the next day to close out the paperwork. Definitely would rent from here again!",2021-10-23 21:43:08 UTC,4,1,0,1,yC4qZbjZxysEV843ueBZnQ

We went to get a drink and as we paid, there is no place on the credit card receipt for a tip...huh?!?  And no tip jar was allowed, apparently.  So these poor bartenders are out there working a major league game and getting tips only from those who happen to have cash on them (remember, the Rays games are all completely cash-less, so I was well trained.)

I called your customer service team twice this morning and was disconnected once. I was trying to reach someone to follow up on my open case claim  ; so your corporate office can reach out again to this location for the photographs. As it has already been over 24 hours! 

Please see below email that has unable to be sent out due to continuous wrong information being given . 

BE AWARE!!! If you read other reviews on multiple sites you can begin to see a nasty pattern of customer complaints and charges. 

My husband and I were charged $500.00 yesterday June 25, 2021 after visiting Idaho on a athletic event  . After check out ; this location based on claims of damage property to a desk was stated ,"" found  by house keeping"" . We've asked  multiple times for the pictures to be sent to me ; including from  corporate office which also called them directly on June 25,2021 your location and requested those pictures to be sent to me also . A official complaint and claim has been opened. 

I stated in my claim we do have stamped time/date video footage of the initial check-in around 5:00pm; as well as video footage of the departure from the room around 6:00am . Which has been shared. As much as we travel we have learned to protect ourselves  the right way incase something like this was to every happen. Sadly to say ; Idaho  will be our first experience of excessive price gouging this week in the hotel industry all over Meridian - Boise . 

As I mentioned to your front office;  it is a different scenario to own up and take accountability for something that you did onto someone else's property if you did such a thing ; it's another thing to make claims that your guest have been the ones to make the damage of that property ; charge them ; and your property continues to refused to send photographs.This is the most unprofessional experience I have every had ; speaking with your front office yesterday was unapologetic, rudeness and nasty display of false allegations. 

Sadly, I can't even get the correct person to help anywhere with this hotel chain. 

Q. How are you going to charge somebody and a large amount of money and then just absolutely refuse to send them what they're being charge for exactly! The whole demeanor changed after we informed them that we had videos ; now we can't get any help and all I want is our money back!!",2021-06-26 14:09:22 UTC,1,0,0,1,xvqBdikfMRxc5Wrb4NDnNw

The hotel was out to get us the day we checked in due to the fact we had teenagers in our party. On check out day, I was unknowingly charged $200 to my credit card for damages in one of my rooms. (This was done after I checked out) No communication was sent to me about these charges. I only noticed it while looking at my credit card bill.

She also said she got busy helping with breakfast after taking the picture and wasn't able to try calling me again. Well, I checked out after 10. Breakfast was long over. So caught herself in a lie. When we finally had a phone conversation, she blamed the damages on the teenagers that were staying in the room. Well, it was the coach in that room, so her plan didn't work.

I have lived in this area and driven past this hotel more times than I can count. I needed to stay closer to the Exton area for work and read reviews on this hotel just to confirm it would be a clean and safe place for a quick stay. 

As soon as I checked into the room and saw the filth from the previous person that stayed there I was immediately uncomfortable with the lack of basic hotel cleanliness standards.

I was so disturbed I told the front desk I wanted a refund and was not comfortable staying there due to the level of filth, about 5 minutes after having checked in.

I was told by the front desk I needed to cancel my reservation with the third party booking agency I used to make my reservation.
I have been going back and fourth with the booking company AND Holiday Inn for almost a week now.

The manager from Holiday Inn says I was checked into another room and stayed there! I was never even offered another room let alone checked into one and stayed in it. I asked for confirmation with my signature on it for the second room that I allegedly stayed in, since I signed a confirmation for my first room when I was issued the key. Neither company can produce this. Even if the hotel pulled video footage they could clearly see I was never issued another room and that I left this hotel no more than 15-20 min after arriving.

Holiday Inn & Traveluro (3rd party booking company) will NOT issue a refund based on the level of filth in the hotel room. Both companies are insisting that I was issued and stayed in a second room at this hotel which NEVER happened or was even offered to me.

We were staying here because we were waiting for our new home to be move-in ready, after it started taking longer than expected we were paying day-by-day. As we are still in the middle of a pandemic, money is hard to come by some days and we were not able to pay right at 11:00am but we always made sure we paid our way that day, the latest payment being made at 1:00pm. Just two hours after check out time.
The front desk clerks never seemed to have an issue with it and even said it was okay and not to worry about it.
However the manager, Devon, had always gave us dirty looks as we were coming in and out of the parking lot as well as, when we would walk into the hotel to go to our room.
We have dogs and I had to walk them twice a day. The manager, Devon, had become extremely rude one day out of the blue, when I was walking my dog outside and told me not to let them use the restroom on hotel property. I didn't have any issue with that and respected it. But I cannot control where my dog goes to the bathroom outside, every time. They don't know there are certain areas they can't go potty, they just know outside is the bathroom. I would make sure I would go off the property but sometimes it would happen right off the property line. Devon was extremely angered by this and got rude and loud with me. Keep in mind, we are quiet, my dogs are very well trained and behaved as they are service animals, and we always cleaned up our messes.
I had got the impression that he is racist due to the statements and accusations he had made about me and my family. He stated: ""it is people like us that ruin his business"" and we ""should be thrown out on to the street"". He said he is better than us, and we ""aren't good enough to stay here"". This had upset me very much and I had cried to my family about it which is extremely disheartening, especially after we had spent over $3000 to stay here over the course of a couple weeks.
This hotel isn't even kept up with or clean. There were roaches in our room, the blankets had stains on them and there was a small bag in the corner of the room that looked like it was used for storing illegal drugs. Not safe for small children, children in general, or dogs which they charge a $20 pet fee per dog, per day.
If I could give this place 0 stars, I would.
I highly and strongly recommend against booking a room here, ever. Devon is not polite to his guests at the hotel. He is rude and prejudice. Do not bring your business here or waste your time and money.",2021-07-28 20:26:32 UTC,1,0,0,0,meNK-2GF6oqNTDkxlxFSwQ

First I booked my reservation June 7th flying in from Las Vegas for a birthday trip . My flight was delayed so I contacted the hotel around 4pm to notify I was going to be late due to the delayed flight. The woman Yvonne I spoke with assured me all was fine as long as I checked in before 2am . Upon arrival could not find my reservation due to the Manager Josh cancelled my reservation at 6:30 stating no phone number or deposit on file which I booked through Costco with no deposit required and all my information showed on my confirmation email of details sent to hotel. I was completely baffled because I had just called and spoke to Yvonne and asked specifically if she needed to write notes on my reservation to ensure everything was ok . Well worst part is they canceled my reservation and could not even fix the issue as I was standing there miles away from home with nowhere to go because now they didn't have any rooms available! Worst part is that I had to search for a hotel not knowing where I'm at and their hotel kept coming up with rooms available but no rooms were actually available to book! So I'm learning you can book a room But show up they have nothing avail because overbooking .I absolutely appreciate Melissa she did everything she could even helping us try to find another hotel in the area due to we were completely stranded ! I arrived at 11pm and could not find a decent hotel in the area until 4am ! The worst experience with holiday inn and I will never recommend this place to anyone I definitely should have read the reviews. Josh as a manager you should abide by your rules that if a customer has until 2am to check in then it should be until 2am and if they do not show cancel. I hope this never happens to you and your family one day .I will definitely also report this to corporate so it is formally documented.Thank you again Melissa you were awesome !,2021-06-19 15:30:56 UTC,1,0,0,0,Vx6FylMLaYCEYnzmywgU_A

Boutique hotels began as not necessarily cheaper options, but more specific ones. If you ever secretly wanted a mini bar filled with PBR and Have a Chips at 2 am, or a hotel/rome service restaurant specializing in Beyond Burgers with picked red onion and a skillet brownie with vanilla ice cream, you should stay HERE! Want a pool venue that looks in photos the way you wished it did? HERE. A cool on premises bar? HERE! As a rule, rooms were smaller, but well appointed with design concepts you preferred--a huge shower and a plush headboard that doubled as a thin mattress cushion for your friend to pass out on? Check.

And not every boutique hotel was luxurious--some just got you: bare bones--a s'mores kit complementary by the fire pit;  wine bar open till 10:30 with the types of wines you were yourself excited about sharing with friends , but the room itself was plywood and white duvets. It could be as simple as Dr. Bronners products in the bathroom. 

But it was NOT a tiny, cheaply appointed room with dinky fixtures and bulk-bought, kitschy wall paper to paste over too-thin walls. It was NOT about telling your clientele rooms are cleaned upon request only; or the pool use must be signed up for in advance because everything and everyone is understaffed and unaware. It's certainly not about a dirty, fire pit uncleaned and filled with trash and cigarette butts or doors that require a key to reenter, with no signage to warn guests or staff to open them.

I want to be clear: this hotel is cheaper than the adjacent Hampton Inn. But, the Hampton Inn operates appropriately like a motel, while this silliness is the self-checkout of accommodations.
 
The Aloft is understaffed (though most of the staff we did meet was very kind, but clearly too busy to spend time communicating): the hotel lost our reservations and could not turn them up even WITH a confirmation number they'd generated, which resulted in hours of back and forth and defined the staff as NOT empowered to feel they could make decisions. There is no on-sight parking or valets, only poorly run shuttles to satellite parking 10 minutes away on foot. Towels, coffee, bottles of water?Must be requested.

This is a hostel--a nice one, but minimalist to the extreme and  camouflaged by modular-style sofas and oversized Janga sets. There is one mini-bar of soap split between the sink and shower. Cinderella did better.

At the bar, which says is open until 12:30 and Missouri has a 1:30 standing last call, we were told we couldn't order anything more without an already standing tab at 10.  

Want some water for a sober chauffeur? The bar tender can't be bothered, ask in the lobby--if you can find anyone to ask.

Again, the price point is good, but this is not functional. We can all do better than this--with our expectations, with our price point AND business models.",2021-10-17 22:42:54 UTC,1,0,0,0,jG15H9Ch_22z7SHiD6wMGQ

We open the door to the room and it smelled like an old musty, smoked in casino (this was a non smoking room), the towel creation on the beds was made out of old stained towels that were once white, the hotel is clearly old and in need of a deep clean. We thought we could handle it for one night until I woke up to go to the bathroom around 1am, flipped on the light and saw roaches running for their life. My son was able to kill one. Needless to say we didn't sleep for the rest of the night and the other hotels in the area were sold out. My sons flight was leaving early in the morning so my original plan was to drop him off and come back and get some sleep before heading back to Florida. Well that didn't happen. We checked out at 3am and I asked the night front desk guy if he was aware of the roaches. Of course he said no but would have it checked out. I asked for a refund and he rudely said he could not refund my because I'd been in the room for too many hours. He could only refund me within 15 min of check in. I don't think roaches tend greet you at the door with their tails wagging. Anyway I drove back to Florida on 2hrs of sleep. Hopefully without any hitchhiking cockroaches or bedbugs. Disgusting and disappointing!

I had to rebook my tour due to cold weather, and had no problems re-booking. We showed up, signed our papers, paid and were on our way. When I submitted my payment I noticed the payment was higher than I expected, but I did not question it right off the bat because I was running a little late and did not want to hold up the tour (big mistake on my part.) Our tour guide Dwayne was awesome! Took us all over, showed us a bunch of dolphins, and even took pictures and videos of us. It was a lot of fun!

After our jet skiing adventure is where things went wrong. First of all, it was awesome that Dwanye took photos and that they were included, but the photos were EXTREMELY blurry to the point we couldn't even see who was in the photos. I texted him back asking if he could email them to me to see if the quality would be better, no response. If you're going to push for ya'll to be the source of photos, at least make them decent photos. We would have taken our own if we knew they would come out so crappy.

But where the issue lies is with the lack of communication with the payments. When I originally booked the rental and tour, the prices listed on the website were $125 for the jetski. No where did it list that the tour guide was an extra $75, but they informed me of that fee when I called to book so it was ok. When I called to rebook, the price was still listed as $125 on the website, and I called on 3/16 to rebook for a tour on 3/20. When I made the payments and I noticed that the fee was significantly higher, I just paid it and went on my way. Yes, I realized I should have asked, but I also should have been informed in some way that the prices were surcharged due to spring break. When I called the next day, whoever I spoke with informed me that prices had gone up. No where on the receipt does it even list what I even paid for, nor the surcharged rate. He just kept saying ""oh its listed on the website"" and when I informed him that when I rebooked the appointment it had not reflected the price change, he ignored me. Yes, I should have asked why the payment was so high, BUT there should have been updated information on the website as well as oh I don't know, maybe informing the caller of the rates or that they recently changed? I wouldn't have booked if I knew I would have been paying an extra 100 bucks! Maybe provide a quote, or at least a detailed receipt to your patrons so they know what they're paying for.

That's literally common business practice.",2021-03-22 14:04:25 UTC,2,0,0,0,A2ye5fo0HkQnEVmQOv8otg

Due to covid, our first choice of venue was unavailable, but that turned our to be a blessing in disguise as we were all so happy with how the day turned out. 
First, the setting is beautiful. We decorated the on site arch with garlands and placed it under the trees for a perfect ceremony.  We set up tables around a dance floor in front of the lodge for our reception.  We did the flowers ourselves and the vibe was just what we hoped for.  There is also a cute gazebo, an indoor hall if you prefer for the reception, a play area off to the side (our flower girls and their brother enjoyed that) , a full kitchen, and a really nice bridal suite. Plus, plenty of parking. 
Second, Cat was awesome from start to finish. She answered all of our questions and offered helpful suggestions and was just super easy to deal with.
Finally, the price was affordable.
So, we were delighted with how the day turned out! A few tips:
We used Cat's lighting (extra fee but very reasonably priced) and this added so much to the vibe.
We did the flowers ourselves (Mayesh in Oxnard wholesale florist) and we are happy that we did.
We had a taco truck and Mariachi band for dinner and our guests loved this.
For dancing, we skipped the DJ and did our own set list and brought in a rented PA system. It worked great!
We had about 50 guests but the venue can easily accomodate a bigger event.
We hired Cat's son to help with bussing and clean up and that freed us up to enjoy the evening.
We highly recommend Cat and the Lion's Park! Thanks for a day we will always remember!!",2022-01-04 20:16:47 UTC,5,0,0,0,RWnsb5GIuGyCyPdxiHwM7g

However, there's certainly something special going on here in the neighborhood known as Chatham Arch. Located along the end of Mass Avenue, this Bottleworks District is creating a breathtaking destination for locals and a tourist destination for downtown visitors all in one while also adding new purpose to the Art Deco landmarks that have long dotted the landscape in this area. 

It would have been easy, and perhaps even tempting, to simply remove these buildings that were nostalgic yet long vacant but instead we end up with functional buildings that celebrate the city's history. 

It's important to note, first of all, that this area is still in development. Key pieces have opened - the Bottleworks Hotel, The Garage Food Hall, the Living Room Theatres, and a couple of shops but other soon to be businesses are still under construction and it appears additional buildings and potential parking are altering the landscape without destroying the vibe (I'm looking at you, Broad Ripple). 

The Garage Food Hall is just that - it's a food hall. It's a destination food hall with 14 different vendors and I believe more to come. The food selection is diverse and ranges from modestly priced options like Clancy's Hamburgers to finer options like J's Lobster Shack. There are retailers, as well, including Pumkinfish that relocated from its previous spot on Mass Avenue. There are also some services, such as a barber shop. The vibe is industrial. You may be thinking about a mall food court, but this is cooler, more communal, and an awful lot more fun. In recognition of the pandemic still going on, it's also open concept with tables 6' apart and employees who are cleaning the heck out of the place. The doorways are traditional doorways (not automatic), but easily 95% of this place has been made accessible for mobility. By the time they get done, you'll have 30,000 square feet of food hall glory.

The Bottleworks Hotel is another Geronimo Hospitality Group joint (think Ironworks). Geronimo thrives in the industrial vibe and they've taken retro chic and industrial and made this one incredible place. 139 keys, that's rooms in hotel lingo, with a restaurant and lounge that I believe is soon to open. The hotel occupies the top two floors of what used to be the Coca-Cola plant's administration building. They've kept the vibe with some glorious updates including a staircase you've simply got to see. Geronimo does accessibility right - I haven't stayed here yet, but I've stayed at Ironworks and I was ready to move in with my wheelchair and all. 

The Living Room Theatres is an eight-screen joint that screams classic Hollywood. There's another staircase here you've simply got to see. This was started by actual filmmakers who know what makes watching a film special and they've added it here. Technically, Living Room is a ""chain"" if you consider having 3 locations a chain. They jumped in early and found the perfect location. I've already been here once and it's glorious. 

The retail spaces will eventually include 143,000+ square feet of retail space with each space ranging from 1,000 to 22,000 square feet. From what's present, you're getting an Indy vibe with some easy recognition that this will be a destination spot. 

Finally, there's even going to be office space here - 175,000+ square feet of people calling this space their Monday-Friday home (at least post-pandemic). I don't believe this space is open at all yet and there's obvious construction going on. By opening in phases, each destination gets perfected. 

There's paid parking to be found. All of Mass Avenue is meters anyway, so this is consistent with the area and it's actually MUCH more convenient. 

I'm not always big on these kinds of destination spots, but having already been down to Clancy's and Lick Ice Cream and Living Room (plus stopping in to see the hotel), I'm a fan and already anxious to return. 

While some concerns are legit, after all Chatham Arch has always been a fairly quiet residential area, so far everything looks quite promising and should help lift Indy's prospects in a post-pandemic world.",2021-01-30 11:20:38 UTC,5,12,4,10,np9qz0vSAKXTd4R1YvFVbQ

The good: the front desk clerk is very professional and friendly. It's very close (under 15 min to Snowcat Ridge) there's a Cracker Barrel/outback and other restaurants right across the street. The pool looks very clean. We didn't use it since the temp was in the low 40s. The lobby is small but well kept

The bad: The rooms were poorly lit. They were dark and were dirty. The darkness o added to how filthy the room was. There were visible broken/damaged things throughout the room and bathroom. The shower looked like it was not properly cleaned, there were visible stains on shower curtain and walls. Door moldings were dirty and had stains and toothpaste on them. There were visible water stains on the room walls and mold on the wall and picture frames. The grossest part was the headboards aren't wiped down so you can see oil stains all over them. There was hot breakfast served. It was basic, you are better off going across the street. I was very disappointed in the level of cleanliness, I will not be returning to this place nor will family or family. I stayed at a  hotel 2 days prior to this one in Orlando and paid a lot less a night and the room looked clean and presentable.

When I was searching for a hotel in Center City, this was a primary point of concern. According to the info on Expedia, parking here was going to be about $30 per day. Which was untrue, but I should have called the hotel ahead to confirm this was current, so I don't blame anyone but myself for that. So- just to make anyone else concerned about parking aware- the hotel offers valet parking only, and it's currently $54/day. We ended up parking in a garage a few blocks away, on 15th and Spruce, for $36/day, and that worked out fine for us. There are also two privately owned surface lots a block from the hotel that are a little cheaper, but we wanted the security of the garage. Once we finally figured out where to park the car, things went much smoother. Check-in was easy. The only other hiccup we had was, when we got to the room, there was an overwhelming fragrance. I am sensitive to such things, and it was quickly giving me a headache. When I laid down on the bed, I realized that it was on the comforter. I don't know if it was the detergent, or if it had been sprayed with something. But I called the front desk, and they quickly sent someone up with a new, not overly-fragranced comforter, and the issue was resolved. The room itself was super clean, and the decor was super cute. The shower was amazing! Spacious and hot, with good water pressure. It was nice & quiet, we never heard any neighbors.

We booked a reservation with our friends also booking a reservation.  Our friends had a truck (16')  towing a Rv overall length of 27'.   We have a smaller class c and since his spot actually was small for his towed camper and truck and we didn't have a car, we let him park in our spot.  

Due to changing weather conditions, we decided to leave after 2 days and the office said they would charge us fully for remaining days and not give us a credit.  So, since we had paid for remaining days and would not get a credit, we told our friend to use our spot to park his truck
in our spot.

But the nasty owners, told him he couldn't use the spot--even though it was ""paid for by us"".  So we don't get a credit, which we are okay with, but we technically ""paid"" for the spot, and want to help our friends out, and they shouldn't double dip!

The Bottleworks Garage is a fun and unique experience with multiples restaurants, two bars, a few shops and barbershop. It is busy no matter the time of day and personally would not take my kids. More of an adult place. It is very loud. The restaurants are all really good. 
There is lacking of seating for the amount of restaurants and they are opening more. With two bars people are taking up seats to drink and talk and then people are walking around holding food with no where to sit. We had to walk back to the hotel with out food and they said ""no seats!"" Sounds like it's a common problem. Two bars and ten restaurants require more seating! 

Hard Truth Distilling- No! Way over priced. Mixed drink specials $15 each for about 2-3oz of liquid. Tiny plastic cup not even filled half the way up. And so much liquor you couldn't taste the flavors they were describing on menu. Our group had four different drinks and all the same. 

Clancy's Hamburgers - Really good and fresh burger! Had the Clancy Burger and cheese fries. Recommend!

We booked two rooms while we were in town for a dog show.  When we arrived and started moving our dog crates in, 3 maintenance men showed up to the room stating the table/desk combo was coming off the wall and the room had been rented before they could fix it.  They were pleasant and we thought we were off to a good start with such proactive maintenance.  Wrong!!

The first room had blood on one of the pillows and the sink's drain pipe wasn't connected so all water ran straight to the floor.  The maintenance fix was to put a bucket under it.  

The second room was worse.  The first thing we noticed was there were no pillows on either bed, just pillow cases.  The front desk was called twice to bring pillows and finally when asked face to face claimed there were no more available.  The light above the sink had 1 functioning bulb out of an entire bar so you could not see other than shadows.  There was a pair of house shoes under one bed and food under the other.  Behind the bathroom door was the blade of an electric shave.  The worst of it all however was the shower curtain which was covered in feces.  It looked as if someone had used it as substitute toilet paper.  The facility was notified and did not address until 24 hours later.  There were no other rooms to move us to.  

I asked about a rate reduction and was told I had to talk to the General Manager Mike King the next business day.  He emailed me an apology but no offer of a rate reduction.  I responded to his email with the details of our stay and requested a phone call.  He did not call, so I called him.

But that's to technical for my likings. This hotel really is SO nice. I am such a hotel snob and so over the battle of having (actually) clean hotel rooms. This hotel literally was spotless from the lobby to each room. The details of the rooms are so nice and really add to beauty! The bathrooms with the wall, shower and floor tiles all being the same just gave it such a better look!

Location is super close to downtown St Petersburg and good eats. Close to Clearwater/St Petes airport (like 5 mins) 30 mins to most gulf beaches. 50-60 mins from siesta key. 20 mins to downtown Tampa! Super good spot that was quiet and had no issue with. Free parking too! 

My points being deducted really came from little things that are hardly worth mentioning. The pillows are so uncomfortable. Do ask for the foam pillows because they are WAY better the the ones on the bed. The bed is comfy that isn't much of a complaint. The water is hot in the shower without a doubt! The other issue we had was the temperature in the room. The thermostat won't let you go below 68 degrees for the AC, and it is hard to set. It would always turn off in the middle of the night and the room would get hot. Very minor complaints! 

The hotel staff is so kind. They were always helpful and really made it enjoyable. We always saw people cleaning too! We had a small incident that is nothing to do with the hotel, we had a small little lizard make it's way to our room and the staff was so good about getting us to a new room ASAP! They gave complimentary drinks as well. Again, it's Florida this stuff happens it was not a big deal and they were SO good about it. The hotel rooftop is great and the drinks are wonderful. Bar tender was super cool! The K bistro restaurant was not open much of any at all in our 5 days here due to staffing shortages. But the rooftop did serve some stuff some there and it was great!

I spent the entire morning on the phone calling Hertz customer service when i should have been on the road to Chicago. I requested that someone call a manager and call me back with options. A guy called me back to tell me there were no options and that someone would call me as cars were returned throughout the day. Nobody ever called me back to resolve. Its been 2 days and no email, no phone call from Hertz. This was a huge inconvenience with no resolution and poor customer service. I expected better. I do not reccommend for anyone to trust Hertz with reservations.",2021-05-17 18:12:22 UTC,1,0,0,0,tqTgxr5g47MUmtoalHQ6Jg

Let me start by saying that my previous experiences renting cars have been fine, but for some reason the stars aligned to give me almost a full month of the worst customer service I've ever experienced. I don't know who has an extra 6-8 hours of free time on their hands when renting a car but I definitely didn't when I rented from Bala Cynwyd enterprise. I was at a wedding all weekend and then off to the shore to visit friends. The car I got was a Nissan Versa, which right of the bat was the lowest quality car I've ever rented in my life. Within 20-30 minutes of 1.5-2hr drive to the wedding venue, I realized that the car I rented in the middle of July in PA during a stretch of over 95F weather had shoddy A/C. The A/C cut in and out the ENTIRE time I had it (multiple days), giving me the most uncomfortable drive; as a 20 something I felt like I was going through the worst of menopause. I definitely thought I might die in that car, so much so that I would try rolling down the window to see if that was cooler, it wasn't they were the same torture. As soon as I got to the wedding location I called Bala Cynwyd and what do you know, the very understanding staff couldn't help me. I called enterprise roadside assistance who could tow me a new car if I had 6-8 hours window to wait during the weekend. On top of that all local enterprise branches were closed or didn't have any cars in their inventory. So after seemingly no viable options being available I sucked it up and thought at least maybe they wouldn't make me pay for this death trap in July. I was wrong. I am not exaggerating I called this branch everyday of my vacation and at least two weeks after to ask, get confirmation, and then later be  charged and denied a refund for this car. Even though everyone seemed very understanding and sympathetic of the situation they put me in, and after being verbally told I wouldn't be charged by the branch manager, they refused to refund me back the money for the car. I finally settled for half refunded but when the bank statement came in less than half was refunded. Needless to say I would not recommend this branch if you expect human level of customer service or a car for that matter, since I did not get what I had booked.

Good lord. I'll do my best to list:

Girl who checked us in was nice, but didn't say anything other than ""here's your room number, sign here here and here."" No WiFi info, nothing about the pool, nothing about who to call if we need something, nothing about suspended stay over service/what to do about housekeeping. 

Floor is sticky dirty. Like your shoes make the ""slurp slurp"" noise with every step. Turns your feet black if you walk without shoes on. We have a double full bed room. We were given 1 set of towels. Bathroom/tub are visibly dirty. 

BUGS FUCKING EVERYWHERE. Crawling on walls, out from behind the mirror above the sink, on headboards, in the mini fridge. I think they are roaches but I'm not sure. Ants in the sink/on the counter. 

AC unit makes horrendous noise. Also won't cool even when set to 60°, it'll barely knock the warmth off. We have to keep the door open for any type of relief from stuffiness. 

Linens visibly unwashed. Something stuck to and smashed onto one of the blankets, something wiped onto it and not washed off too. Black marks on the towels. Nothing smells like bleach or even mild soap smell. The one set of towels we were given wasn't enough for 3 of us staying so we asked for extra towels. Front desk told us we had to bring others to exchange them, but they don't offer stay over service during Covid. Lol... so, one set of towels for a double room, and I have to bring dirty ones down to you for clean ones?! He gave in and gave me two sets but was not happy about it. I don't want your crappy towels, my man. I just want some attempt at feeling clean while I stay in this filth hole. 

Pool is no longer heated, not sure if this is permanent or heater is just broken. Ice cold in January. (Not a huge deal, just disappointing on a 75° day for it to be unusable.) 

0/10, do not recommend staying here. Quality has diminished significantly since we first stayed here under another brand a while back. Price is way too high for what you get. If you have no other options, I recommend picking up some bleach and Raid before checking in. Consider your own towels while you're at it.",2022-01-17 01:03:13 UTC,1,0,0,0,lZHBAnKVr5umKyVueFnY_w

We were hosting a seminar for a government agency at this location. We explained that we had two small packages coming in and we'd appreciate it if they could get the packages either to our room, or hold at the front desk for our seminar. We were clear on arrival, clear the next morning (day the packages were expected), and clear in our questioning on the third day before the seminar began.

Each time, we were told ""don't worry, we deal with packages all the time.""

We never received the packages (more on that later)

Then, the evening of the seminar, we discover that Eric at the front desk, had made an error and we didn't have a reservation for that night, so we had 30 minutes to get out of our room following our seminar, to move to another room that he'd ""taken the liberty to reserve because of the mistake."" 
Oh, BTW, you'll have to move to ANOTHER ROOM for the next night, due to ""our mistake."" 

We said ""screw it"" and decided to move to our next hotel two nights early, as we were teaching at another city 3 hours away.

Before leaving, we asked again for our packages that were expected two days previously, that Amazon had said were delivered ""to the front desk."" Again, we were told the package hadn't arrived.

We left, drove the three hours to our next hotel, and I re-ordered the products for our AV system to be delivered at the current hotel. 

Two days later, we get a phone call from the front desk at the Odessa location. ""We're really sorry, your packages did arrive, but they were delivered to the mailbox in our lobby. The front desk manager is the only one with a key, so it doesn't get opened very often. Gee, we're so sorry.""

And then, even though this was THEIR ERROR, they charged us $15.00 to ship it to our next hotel. 

Except, they didn't ship it per their promise, they held the package until two days ago (14 days after we've left their property), and called saying they'd ship it to our home, and tried to AGAIN charge ANOTHER $15.00 to send it to our home. 

They screwed up nearly everything they could, and collected extra cash from us to pay for our shipment that they screwed up in the first place.

All this without pointing out that their staff wears masks around their necks, no Covid precautions in this hotel at all, dirty conference room, embarrassingly noisy staff (calling down the hallways to each other early in the a.m.) and a general trailer-trash approach to everything.

The only redeeming thing about this junk property was the closeness to a decent Starbucks, and a couple great restaurants.

I have been staying at this hotel since 2006. It is hard to believe it's been 15.5 years. I have had many memories here. From my wedding, to our adoption party and recently our daughters confirmation. Of course there has been visits here and there and a 2.5 week stay when we were going from one base to another during Christmas. It truly is a home away from home for my husband and myself and now our two children. 

The staff is always kinda, helpful and willing to step up when needed. The front desk has always been helpful. The managers throughout the years have also been helpful. They have all made us feel like ""family"". Kelsi has been around for so many years and she just remembers us all the time. She is so sweet to our kiddos which is always appreciated. 

During the holidays they decorate. They make it feel like a home. It is always nice to make it feel like a home away from home. As a military family it is always nice to have something like that even when we are in transition or just visiting.

Depending on the room we have sometimes I find myself sitting in the lobbying so my family can sleep since I am a night  owl. I have never felt awkward being down there. 

There is a basketball court in the back, a pool, grills, a nice fire place inside, a gym, a nice lobby front and back. They also accept pets which has been a bonus for us when we are traveling with our cats from base to base.

This hotel has been around since about 2005. It has gone through some updates here and there which is great. But, some updates and repairs that already occurred could use some fine tuning. For example there must have been a repair in our room we have now and the ceiling is a different color in multiple spots. They should have just painted the ceiling all over so it matches. Things like that. 

As I sit in the lounge reflecting on how this hotel has truly become a home away from home. Thank you Audubon Homewood-suites Hilton for always taking care of us and so many other patrons.",2021-11-28 02:29:32 UTC,5,6,1,6,e5m5InZKLHvAFW3iclAVsw

We booked a lake view king suite at the government rate of $126 which was really quite a deal! 

Check in was easy and our room was ready on time. We got there right at 3pm. Our room was on the 3rd floor and not too far from the elevator. The room was very spacious and had very nice amenities such as a microwave which you normally dont get in a hotel room unless specifically asked on request and have to pay extra for, it had a modern lighted vanity mirror which was great for applying make-up, additional hanging space for clothes outside the closet, a large built in storage bench for luggage, an ergonomical office chair, and a coffee table that extended up for comfortable eating on the couch or using a laptop.

The decor and color scheme was very nice. It was mid-century modern in cool tone colors like chartreuse and dark electric blue. The bed was firm but comfortable and there was an array of different pillows from soft to medium firm. The view of the lake was also peaceful and  you could see the outdoor hangout area below.

Breakfast was included and that came in handy for some much needed greasy food after spending all night drinking at a wedding. We had their biscuits and gravy and some extra sausage patties.

The location of the hotel was also close to a few breweries and the highways. Would recommend to anyone staying in this area.",2021-04-14 16:10:41 UTC,5,2,1,4,ZcUY5n-6LBK7Ntt8wNwMag

We stayed here at the end of June when the weather wasn't the best, it was rainy, hot and *very* humid.  So humid in fact, that the a/c couldn't keep up because the carpet, as well as the slate-style tile in the bathroom and entry was damp and towels weren't getting dry after a shower or drying hands, either.  I'd left a makeup wipe out of the package one day, came back to the room 8 hours later, and it was still wet.  It should have been as dry as a bone.  It's apparent the hotel has been renovated somewhat recently but it wasn't really done very well.  There was black mold in the bathroom right by the rubber base moulding behind the toilet which began to smell by the 3rd day. There were water stains on the wall next to the sink and, I realized the new roll of toilet paper that was sitting on the back of the toilet had been taken from the room while I was out the second day. Who does that, and why?  The rubber base moulding was peeling away from the wall in another part of the room.  The lamps were old and all scratched and the desk chair wasn't in the best shape, either.  There wasn't enough parking for the amount of rooms this place has (39 spaces actually), and only 1 handicapped space.  So people were parking anywhere they could.  This hotel probably has 3 times that many rooms so why there would only be so few spots is beyond me.  The bed was somewhat comfortable but the pillows were really small so it was hard for me to get situated to be able to sleep very well.  I will say one thing for this room though, it has *lots* of outlets and usb ports for all your electronics.  The staff was really nice and accommodating and I liked that the room had a full size mini fridge (as opposed to a 6-pack fridge) and a microwave.  There really needs to be a small dining table in the room, there's enough room for one. Overall, this was just an ok room for the price.",2021-06-28 13:16:17 UTC,3,0,0,0,MCLeOYJc9mdCitfvNYsYDA

Once at the hotel, we were given a handicap unto. No tub the floors were dirty, carpet smelly, walls dirty, I went to front desk ask for a non handicap room and I was told they didn't have more rooms 
I didn't believe it because the parking was empty. 
I have to admit that I have stayed at HI hotels that ate decently but this one needs to be torn down and rebuild.
I feel that I needed to shower and disinfect after my staying",2021-09-10 13:15:34 UTC,1,0,0,0,qetYOKgetDo1Zynxlx45nA

We planned a road trip and made a reservation through booking dot com for a one-night stay at Holiday Inn Express Frazer-Malvern on October 9. The reservation was made 16 days before the arrival time. When we arrived at the hotel at around 8:30pm, the lady working at the front desk told me that the hotel canceled my reservation and they had notified booking dot com, who was supposed to call me. I told her that I never received any calls or emails from anyone regarding this cancellation and she said it's the responsibility of booking dot com. Then I asked ""When did you contact booking dot com for this cancelation?"" She replied that she made the call to booking dot com ""today"" and it was during the daylight time so that ""you would have some time to find a place"".  I asked her how she could expect me to find a place if the reservation was canceled on the same day, and I asked her the reason for this cancelation. She said ""Based on our policy, it's first come, first served."" Then I said I already submitted my credit card to you when I made the reservation, and you confirmed the reservation. If I don't show up, you could charge my credit card. Why did you still give my room to someone else? She replied that ""Everyone submitted their credit card."" We asked the lady to write down her name and the cancelation date, and she agreed. During this conversation, another hotel staff member was standing beside her and observing silently.  We left the hotel and started driving in the area to look for a place. After driving around for an hour and also checking with multiple hotels both in person and online, we learned that all hotel rooms in the area were either sold out or would cost 2-3 times higher than the rate if booked in advance since it's a long weekend Saturday night and we were trying to find a place in the last minute. When we realized how expensive it was to get a hotel room in the area that night we started suspecting that the reason Holiday Inn Express canceled our reservation might be because the rate sold to customers who booked in advance was relatively lower. We also called booking dot com and they said they didn't receive any notification from Holiday Inn Express regarding the cancellation. At 11:19pm, Booking dot com sent me an email saying our reservation that night was canceled and it was the first formal cancellation notification that I received. We don't blame booking dot com because if Holiday Inn Express canceled the reservation on the same day of our arrival, regardless if I got notified or not, we won't be able to find an alternative option with such a short notice. Holiday Inn Express is the one who should take 100% responsibility. If they have the so-called ""first come, first served"" policy, they should announce it clearly on their website so customers who don't agree with this policy should not make a reservation with them. Furthermore, if they don't want to honor the reservations booked through a third party, they should directly tell those booking sites and stop using those sites to market their hotel rooms. We lost our precious time and risked our safety driving late at night to look for a place to stay due to this hotel's greed and irresponsibility. I am spending time writing this to help fellow travelers: If you don't want your trip to be ruined, stay away from Holiday Inn Express! In addition, I will report this incident, together with Holiday Inn Express's ""first come, first served"" policy to other major hotel booking sites including Expedia, Kayak, Orbitz and so forth so that they can reevaluate their partnership with Holiday Inn Express. If we allow this kind of overselling and cancellation from happening again and again, the credit system of hotel reservation across the world will collapse and it will hurt both hotel businesses and the travelers.

Called to get details and said as long as we bought food and drinks we could visit the pool, fair enough I thought.
Pull into the garage and a security guard walked up telling me parking is $20. No one told me that when I called and would have been good to know.  Get to the pool and order margaritas. The lady says she is new and literally took 30 minutes at her little portable bar to make them. I can only imagine she had to Google the recipe because when I got them they were the worst margarita that I have ever had and I have been drinking them for 35 years. Based on that I was scared to try the food. The pool was packed full of kids and I somehow had the image in my head that it would be more of an adult environment. So, just shortly left and never returned and that's a shame because I live just down the street.

To start, the rooftop bar isn't what we expected. We've been to Hotel Zamora and Karol which has an awesome one and we were expecting something similar. Instead it was a roof with some chairs thrown around and a portable bar - no decor, no real vibe. It felt like an after though or like it was mid-construction. Not even a built in bar... c'mon. Do yourself and go to Zamora or Karol instead (for the bar or the hotel!).

The rooms are ok, but again nothing special, no wow factor, nothing that would ever make me say, I've got to stay there again, especially since it's not even on the beach.

The pool closes early... around 9. We are a young couple and wanted to head to the hot tub and pool after we came home from dinner and were annoyed to see that we could not.

Vibes restaurant, which is more of a small cafe, has a boring menu with a high price tag. They say they have fun exotic style foods, when truly it's just a knock off of every other beach bar around. There is nothing different or exotic - I would love to what credentials the culinary brains behind this menu development has.

- Security and COVID protocols

Let me tell you -- this hotel was a dream! Where to start.

First - this place is stunning! The pictures don't do it justice. Located in the heart of University City, Philadelphia - the hotel is clean, modern, and chic. Added bonus for us? It is super close to the Penn Museum, our wedding venue. The rooms, apartments really, have sweeping views of the city and are full with light and character which includes wide-plank Italian white oak flooring, huge spaces for dining and entertaining, and custom furniture. And by the way, all the rooms are all above the 20th floor so the eye candy you get looking at the stunning scenery of Philly's skyline does not disappoint. Pro-tip, we ordered groceries via delivery service and stocked our fridges with fruits and veggies and snacks for when folks popped by or for general hanging out. The enormous and beautiful accommodations made for an excellent hangout spot for our bridal parties and families. The bedrooms have huge, snug, clean beds with blackout shades and all the plugs for all the cords you need. Did I mention the bathrooms? Welcome to the lap of luxury. The showers and amenities literally make it feel like you're enjoying a day at the spa. The AKA EVEN set us up with a private space in their ""Boardroom"" on Level 28 with sweeping views for the bridal parties to get hair and makeup ready. The lounge where we held our rehearsal cocktail party (instead of a stuffy traditional dinner) was incredible - gorgeous floor to ceiling windows, a chic bar, and a lovely outdoor space. Did I mention the pool and cinema? Yeah ... they've truly got it all.

Important to also note that the AKA has some serious next level customer service. Wow. Every member of the AKA Team was helpful, courteous, and kind. Whenever we needed anything they were there to assist and/or help us to problem solve. Example - our ride to the venue ran into a huge snag and we were running late SO THEY DROVE US THERE IN THEIR TESLA at a moment's notice. I mean that was pretty cool, one to have my panic attack prevented but two brides popping out of a Tesla on our wedding day was legit rad! They handed out our gift bags at the front desk, got our guests settled with ease, set us up with an open sky level meeting room for us for our hair and makeup, and allowed us to rent out their AMAZING rooftop lounge for our rehearsal gathering which ended up being a beautiful cocktail party. We also used it for brunch the morning after the wedding. Omg. The weather was stunning and I got to bid farewell to my west coast family with the beautiful breeze, the sun shining perfectly, and a beautiful city as the backdrop to conversations that reminisced about the evening before with bloody Marys and mimosas. Did I mention they even sent us flowers on our wedding day? The people who work there were so cool and so nice it almost felt like they were our own friends and family. Like, they cared that much about making sure our wedding weekend was a success.

A few folks who I wanna mention by name that went ABOVE and BEYOND. Carla oversaw our room block and was courteous, flexible when she could be, provided frequent updates, and responded promptly. Jacklyn oversaw our events. Was fabulous. Helped us set-up playlists, coordinated with our event vendors, made sure the rooms were set-up well, even had the bar create dueling cocktails during the rehearsal dinner. She was a great leader, very responsive, and made sure things were set-up early enough that we could take a look and make any changes if needed (they didn't need to change a thing). Evan made sure that we had access to the spaces and that we had an adequate room block. Really knowledgeable. Even upgraded the bridal suite.

Five stars. A+. If you are considering this and another place, your search is over. The AKA Hotel wins everything. My wife and I plan to stay here on our year anniversary though ... so don't book then okay? Thanks!",2021-12-06 17:08:57 UTC,5,0,0,0,DNW6cdXiQea3zVbM8wQ8Pg

My thoughts are shared on various social media platforms and smaller communication outlets or methods. The first thing that sticks out is; Live! does not match your status equally to other casino cards. Other casinos match top tier statutes at the same level. Also if there are host for 'high rollers' the were difficult to find. I'm friends with 2 such people. The nights dedicated to The Prime Rib soft opening or 'special event' did not appear in the least bit diverse. 

The decor is classic casino nothing noteworthy. I will say it's laid out nicely, it would be difficult to get 'lost'.  The standard various game choices are available along with sports betting. You will find several places to eat all with accurate corresponding prices points so, something for everyone.

We showed back up around 6 to no other cabanas rented and the girl said the discount would now go from $200 to $150 (for a few hours instead of the $75 promised - okay we paid and paid for many drinks, food, and tips). Then we find out it should have been lesser amount and the server pocketed the extra money after we paid and tipped more. Told the manager who basically said we were lying. Counted all my money this morning and confirmed yes we paid the full $150, not the $100 the server claimed. We live 10 min away, have spent a lot of money here several times and would rent again, tip and stay there but honestly worse people ever and it ruined the night.

Some of my disappointment is due, admittedly, to COVID-19 protection rules, but some of my disappointment is simply the management's total lack of consideration for their guests.

We checked in mid-week to an almost empty hotel. It was late at night, and the check-in went flawlessly. Then, before 7am, I was awakened to a racket of construction and hammering immediately outside my window. (A new hotel, apparently, is going up.)

What I don't understand is how the Cambria's management, with rooms on all four sides of the hotel, would choose to slot guests into the rooms immediately adjacent to the construction noise, when so many other options for a more tranquil stay are available.

Housekeeping services were suspended ""due to Covid"" (with a ""no entry to occupied rooms"" policy) so there was no service at all during our stay.
There were two of us sharing a room, but there was only one (!) K-cup coffee pod. I called down and asked for additional pods and was promised some would be brought up, but none ever were.

One the plus side, parking was problem-free. The location is great. The rooftop bar might be attractive but it was closed while we were there, so I really can't comment.

But overall, for the price, and the absence of common sense on the part of the management, we won't be staying here again.",2021-02-15 21:28:57 UTC,2,1,0,2,KLv1im-BXosLvIkE3bzTfg

We were referred to their hotel/apartments from CHOP as they supposedly have CHOP rates for families in need. From the get-go something seemed a bit "" car salesmany"" about her; which I overlooked as we were in a bind and needed to try to come up with a solution as quickly as possible. Carla knew from the beginning that our unborn daughter has a very rare heart condition in which she would need several open heart surgeries to ""fix"" and an even rarer chest wall defect that again, requires surgery. Even with knowing that information it almost seemed as if she was trying to ""upsell"" me with their apartments. I'm in sales- and I know the tactics and she was definitely using them. Which to be honest is extremely uncomfortable given the situation we're in financially with the necessary medical costs to help save our daughters life. When we originally were quoted, we were quoted a rate that was too high. She asked us what we could afford and magically she was able to make it happen. After speaking with my husband, the number I initially stated we could afford seemed out of reach because that's when we found out about additional surgeries. That's when she basically threw it back in my face and said ""oh, well I did exactly what you asked"". I explained what happened and she tried the additional sales tactics stating most of the other hotels in the area don't have kitchens or washers and dryer's and we'd be forced to eat out every night and go to the laundromat. It was all too salesy for me and was a bit offensive, so we basically responded with ""we're not going to spend additional money on ourselves when that money can go towards our daughters medical bills that are necessary for her survival"". At that point I think she got the hint and backed off a bit.
Flash forward to yesterday- only 2 weeks after the last conversation we had regarding the apartment. My job was kind enough to try to help get our family some help due to everything going on. It's not definitive but something they're really trying to process for us. With the additional funding we could afford AKA. I excitedly reached back out to Carla because I FINALLY felt like things were aligning after months of stress going back and forth with our doctors and trying to find a place to live. Suddenly, once they found out I may have additional funding the rates went up over 60%! Keep in mind, we were never told that the prices could change- especially so quickly. If we were told differently we would have acted upon something more aggressively. I have all the text messages between Carla and I to prove it. Literally 2 weeks prior we were offered a rate that was $65 less per day but then magically it increased? I've been in the hospitality business- including property management and I can tell something fishy was going on. After voicing my concerns that we were being taken advantage of, Carla said she'd speak with her director and get back to me. The next day, I called and spoke with the director (who I will admit was much more pleasant to speak with but unfortunately not very helpful) and she basically told me ""oh yeah, Carla should have told you the rates could increase, I'm sorry"". After months of trying to solidify something- all of it boiled down to ""sorry"".
When a couple is going through a hardship such as trying to save their child's life- the last thing they need is additional stress. Unfortunately that's EXACTLY what AKA did. I cannot in good faith recommended a place that takes advantage of vulnerable people and leaves them high & dry because they can all of a sudden book rooms at higher rates. Don't say you'll help families in need and then leave them hanging the second you can book a room at full price. That's classless and quite frankly heartless.",2021-04-27 04:23:09 UTC,1,0,0,0,UPXZDBN9OgBQEChROxwPmA
gGyPa2upZ33_cZxryI1hZg,Residence Inn Reno Sparks,"Hotels, Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services",Sparks,39.533397,-119.723918,4,26,NV,"First time staying here just for one night. First impressions were it is confusing to find this darn place  because its in sort of a big shopping center/complex with a weird layout and once you find your way back there the hotel itself is laid out way different than any other I have seen but very beautiful in the lobby and looks nothing like what you think of when you think Residence Inn. This one is very nice, swanky even. Very pretty patio and grill area, bigger and nicer than any other locations I have seen. It is the hotel type rooms not the cute little cabin style that is the case sometimes with RI brand.
Lady working the desk when we arrived around 230ish was very nice, I didnt quite catch her name but it ended with ""ella"" it sounded like so Bella, Stella, Hella, very nice employee. Our room wasn't ready yet so we sat in the lobby and waited maybe 20 to 30 minutes, not long and not a problem, we had arrived a little before 3. Elevators are very large and really nice for an elevator. You do get an extra card key to work the power switch beside your entrance door. We were provided with two hand wipes, unsure if thats their usual or not.
Veey nice looking breakfast area but we did not partake of the breakfast and I wish we had because Marriott breakfasts are usually so bad I should have checked but I didnt, I had strawberries and cookies (ssshhh!) in my room and watched football. Lol

There is only 1 ice machine and it is on the ground floor right by the elevators. You will thank me for this info later on.

My biggest thing when I stay somewhere is getting the room cool, you will see it on all my hotel reviews, if its not cool, I'm not a happy camper. This one sadly, I will have to put in the category of not cool enough...for my needs. It would only go down to 66 and did not have an on all the time option, only fan low or fan high, another thing I hate. The coming on and off again while in a hotel room, is too disturbing and I can't sleep. Last night was a prime example of that. When the air went off it was super quiet which is bad for me, I can't sleep and it was my own fault in part because I did go off and forget my fan that I always travel with. The silence was deafening! The a/c said 66 but no way, I was too hot, it was nowhere near 66. I need cold and I need it to run all night, daytime it can go off and on but for sleeping, needs to be on. Just my personal preference, not a law.  Lol

For one night it was a nice studio room. Not my first choice for long stays but I can live with it one night. Cute little kitchen wirh two bar stools, decent sized living room, good size desk area and a tv on a swivel so you can watch it from the living room or the bedroom. No wall between those two areas because it is a studio. Plenty of storage space throughout, some shoddy workmanship around windows and closet doors had some damage but that wasn't crucial and what looks like shoddy work could also be earthquake damage or some such. Cute shelf on the kitchen wall with a little tray built in for keys, change, phone, etc. 

Bathroom was nice, the big mirror has lights around it which work great for a nightlight, no horrific middle of the night potty breaks having to turn on the big light! First time seeing this kind of shower door in any Marriott and first one I have used that didn't leak all over the floor! Fantastic! When you get in the shower the handle is right there and the shower head is way over there. Large bottles of body wash, shampoo and conditioner to use and I did because again for one night I didn't bother to pack my own. Now I didn't care for any of them, lemon/sage not a smell I like but it was there and I appreciated it. The best part is the shower head! If you read my reviews you know I love a good shower and I was excited to see they have the Speakman!!! Ohhhh my, big love! I liken it to the elephant shower nozzle Kramer gets on the Seinfeld episode. Worth the price of admission! 

When we checked out the lady working asked if there was anything they could have done better or different and we said there wasn't anything. I dont feel mentioning the a/c is worth it. I know no place is going to change it for me so its not worth complaining about. It is just a temporary place I am staying so I deal with it best I can. Its why I travel with my own fans but I also don't usually forget them!  Lol.

I would stay here again, hopefully a week night so we see what all we missed and I promise to try breakfast next time, it did smell really good when we walked by checking out.",2021-09-13 08:04:42 UTC,3,2,1,3,cwhi8ptrNGZ3kG2JhQgo0w

Maryland Live Casino is my absolute favorite casino, so I figured Philly should be similar. I was wrong. The parking garage was a disaster. It doesn't tell you how many parking spots are open, nor does it have the green lights above the spots, to make it easier to find parking, like MD live. Garage is very small, and I couldn't see any signs directing me where to enter. 

The casino itself, is so confined, if you're over 300 lbs, or extremely clostrophobic,  just don't even bother.. you will not be able to walk through and look at some slots. 

If you want to smoke a cigarette, you have to leave through the entrance, and when you want come back in, you have to wait in the very long line, and get your ID checked again.  MD Live has smoking patios at each end of the poker room, and also a designated room where you can play slots, smoke, and breathe the fresh air outside, because it has an awning along the back wall. 

As I'm trying to leave, I see a huge line of people at the entrance. As I kindly excuse myself through all these people, I get to the elevator and realize that  the line of people at the door, are actually waiting for the elevator to leave. Okay, no problem, so I asked an employee if there were stairs I could take.. NOPE. No stairs.  

I saw no waitresses walking around, while playing poker for hours, and we aren't allowed to drink anything in the poker room. Not even water.

We rented an SUV Aug 2021 to drive my daughter to college in FL. An emotional journey, but also exciting. We got an SUV hybrid which was not big enough for all her things. Be aware the mid-size SUV could be pretty small. They had limited inventory (which is understandable during these times) so we had to pay $600 to ship the rest of her things. The person who helped us Nick, was not very helpful and seemed annoyed with us from the start as we asked if there was any additional options. 

On the way to university we were hit from behind at a stop light. We were shocked and fortunately not injured. The car had minimal damage as we were the 3rd car hit by impact. We were still able to drive our daughter to school. We informed  Enterprise and our insurance right away. We dropped car off late when we returned after long journey. 7am next morning Nick called us as we were asleep. He called again at 8am, then got a hold of my husband at 9am.

Nick proceeded to rudely tell my husband if he did not call the insurance to file a claim immediately they would charge us a daily car rental fee. We had already stated claim was in process, while enterprise also started a claim so our insurance company did double the work. Nick was belligerent and didn't even ask if we were okay even though accident was not our fault one bit. It was such a terrible thing to happen and the way he handled this was HORRIBLE! He told my husband he was the manager which we believe is not the case. That being said, if anything god forbid happens to you while renting a car with this location, do NOT expect one bit of respect or customer service from this location!!",2021-08-18 23:21:33 UTC,1,1,0,12,0awcdxDmMf_HwG5ZwOR2fQ

The bonvoy app said this hotel got decent ratings. The pictures looked nice; I should have checked Yelp!
Parking lot was almost full. Found a spot and headed inside. While I could check in online, I still needed a key. 
The hotel desk member was quick, kind, and efficient. The line of people ahead of me went fast. She was working alone and it was almost 11pm. 
When it was my turn, she referred to me by name and offered me cookies. Apparently they do warm cookies for Marriott members. I declined and went to my room. 
The hotel has a two person per elevator rule due to covid, so I waited. 
My room smelled a bit wet as prior reviews have suggested. I figured it was the window AC unit. 
I put my stuff down then went to wash my face. We were at an 80s party, so I had pink, yellow and blue all over my eyes. I was grateful for the single serve makeup eraser towel; I used that to get a head start, then used my own soap. 
I returned to the bedroom area, and was deciding which bed to sleep in, when I noticed the nightstand. Something was there..... upon further injection, I realize there are toenail (or long fingernail) trimmings on the second shelf of the nightstand and it's base. At that moment, I thought about calling housekeeping. But then I thought what if that isn't the only issue?
So I grabbed my belongings and headed back to the lobby to check out and drive home. It would be a long drive but at least I'd be comfortable in my own room/bed. 
The gal at the desk was understanding. I showed her the pictures. She checked me out and said I would get a full refund in 3 days. The email portfolio for my stay arrived within minutes. I was checked in for less than 15 min. I'll verify the refund this week. I wasn't sure they'd offer me a refund, but I'm glad they did. Marriott does provide great service. 
This might be a fluke. It's unfortunate. It's an oversight by the cleaning crew. It was one of the cheaper hotels in regard to price. I figured it was a deal because I booked same day. I literally just wanted to crash, wake up, and drive home. I wasn't drunk but I had already driven 3 hours to get to the party, so I didn't want to do that twice in one day. Oh well! I'm home, safely.",2021-05-16 11:33:30 UTC,2,8,3,13,OVlN9ray5IWDRr0070Q8_w

I bought a 'coach' from Pedata. Flew in from Mn. 2 days after my mom died and purchased the 'coach' and started driving home. The check engine light came on after approx 400 miles. We continued on as it was not an option to stop due to covid. 
We made it home to MN. It was taken into the local mechanic to have the check engine light fixed and ended up replacing the ignition coil to the tune of $400.00
 1 week later we loaded up to travel to Kansas City Mo. to drop my moms belongings to my sister and we made it to South of Des. Moines when the entire rear end blew out. We were forced to sleep on an exit ramp then have a wrecker tow us to the next town. We stayed in the mechanics parking lot for 4 days while it was repaired. We were told the rear end had so much fine sand in it that they thought maybe the 'coach' had been in a flood. The bill for that breakdown was almost $7000.00. The mechanic took pictures and kept the parts because he recommended a reimbursement from the dealer. 
 After we were on out way again to home, The check engine light came on, the automatic step quit working and it began vibrating enough to run you off the road.....
Back to the mechanic we went....This time all ignition coils failed and 3 of the 10 spark plugs had no spark at all! ANDDDDD....another 500.00 in repairs, we still have not been able to fix the step (it is stuck halfway out). 
  When I sent the info to Pedata, they were kind enough to send me a letter through their attorney saying I cannot contact them anymore. 

I will warn you right now, they made all kinds of promises and assured me the 'coach' was so good, safe and trustworthy. 

Pedata will sell you junk and laugh at you when you leave. I am a hard working nurse and a ranchers wife. This was my first big venture in buying on my own. I bought this so I could travel with my grandchildren and enjoy family camping. 
It is a shame that Pedata hurts the American family and will not stand behind their 'coaches' they sell.

The heat/air is on a thermostat but the unit is a very old style hotel floor unit and think with a brand new hotel the rooms could have regular air vents? The bathroom was very clean and modern.

Overall our family had a wonderful time. As soon as you walked In the lobby, you can tell they had just cleaned it. The smell of sanitization, made my heart warm. Lobby was clean, front desk rep. That checked us In was quick and friendly!

Room - we had a double Queen on the 2nd floor. Typical size room, but clean. Had a refrigerator but no microwave. I'm wondering if that's something you need to request if you want it?

Dining area - small but cute and cozy. Surprisingly they served a full breakfast. I say surprisingly because previous hotels we stayed at, did not serve it for ""covid"" reasons. Staff served the food, they were masked and gloves on. I was pleased. Limited seating for obvious reasons (covid).

Pool- very small! But it worked for our small group! Just don't forget your room key or you'll be locked out and need to walk around. 

Laundry room- located on 2nd floor - $2/coins only. Front desk had it available.

Gym- very small just a couple of equipments.

I've stayed in nearby Maryland Heights on previous occasions, but wanted somewhere with a little more to offer, in terms of walkable eateries and things to do.

A last minute choice led me to Tru. Being a fairly new hotel, I knew I would be comfortable. Unfortunately, my first room was underneath some little kids jumping around - and the second one had a dog across the hall who was yapping enthusiastically, repeatedly expressing himself. In other words, he wouldn't stop barking! The very understanding front desk gal led me to a room on the south side of the hotel, away from the hustle and bustle of the main drag, however, there was some road noise to deal with.

Regardless, I was finally settled in for a few days! I really enjoyed my stay. The bed was super comfy, the wall mounted squeeze bottles of soap and shampoo smelled great and, bonus, are more environmentally friendly than like, 1,000 small plastic bottles.

The breakfast spread offered soooo many options...fresh waffles, fruit, yogurt, bagels, eggs, sausage, cereal and more! The staff was super accommodating and very nice with every interaction.

There's a QT gas station with plenty of drinks and snacks next door and many restaurants and shops within walking distance. I highly recommend staying here! I was able to get in a haircut and do some clothes shopping, too. :)",2021-07-10 01:42:17 UTC,5,2,2,2,XYudDq2zndgNCyEqIXeaXg

But when I got inside, I was comforted because it was very clean and orderly. The person who greeted me was very professional and friendly. My room was on the second floor and when I stepped off of the elevator I smelled a little musty odor. I was really concerned that it was not going to be a good stay but I changed once I stepped into my room. I got King bed room. It wasn't as updated as the other Fairfield Inns that I've stayed in but it had all of the basics. It had a 42 inch TV, a refrigerator, a microwav,  and a small coffee maker. The carpets were clean, too. I always check the bed and there were no signs of bed bugs or bugs of any kind. The bathroom is nothing special. There was a little rust around the drain hole in the tub but it was clean. The highlight of my stay was the Paul Mitchell products. I washed my hair in that wonderful smelling Tea Tree shampoo and that Lemon Sage conditioner. It was awesome! I also enjoyed the Lemon Sage body wash. I usually use my own soap but it smelled so refreshing and clean that I continued to use it throughout my stay. One thing that kind of spooked me was I was getting out of the shower and I happened to look up at the fan and there was a little green light inside of the fan! Now anyone who has watched any of those creepy movies where there's a stalker who uses cameras to spy on their victims, a little, hidden,  flashing light in the bathroom fan makes you wonder... So, I called down and the receptionist didn't know why the light was there but she called maintenance and then when they didn't call back she went into one of the rooms and saw the light in that room too. She asked a manager and the manager said she's not quite sure what it was but it's in every room so it might be some kind of Sanitation or air filter or something like that but it was pretty damn creepy! I don't know y'all. 

Anyhoo, Breakfast is served from 6:30 a.m. to 10 am. They had the standard fare of hot breakfast including eggs, sausage, tater tots, and biscuits. You can even make your own waffles. I didn't see the waffle mix so it might not have been offered right now. And if you're in a hurry and have to get to work, they have to-go boxes and a nice woman who fixed me a to-go box. It wasn't a bad stay for the price point.",2021-12-19 22:12:02 UTC,3,5,0,5,IhiUaacYvCVv1Hq_5PHWRg

I really enjoyed this place. We only stayed one night as we were traveling across the country from Florida. However, it's my new go to spot for Fairview Heights. 

First, the hotel was very clean and welcoming. The front desk attendant was quick, efficient and more importantly friendly. It was nice to encounter someone who seem to enjoy their job.

Next, the rooms are spacious and comfortable. My wife and I sanitize all the touch areas when we arrive at any hotel and were pleased to find that this room had obviously been clean before we got there. To me, it shows the entire team cares about their hotel and their guest.

We were very happy to see they had transitioned to a guest-serve breakfast buffet. However, we were happier to see three managers observing the buffet, making notes on product placement, hygiene, and rearranging it so flow was conducive to social distancing. Big plus to these three.

I booked the hotel in advance on May 19 for 2 days, so that when we arrive from California, I thought we will immediately check into the hotel, 7 am in the morning,because I already reserved for 4th of June.  But then a surprise awaited us (((

 I was told that since I did not show up and did not check in on June 4, your reservation was canceled and there are no more rooms, but at the same time this rude person at the reception also said you can make a new  a reservation for $ 277 per night, which is correspondingly much higher than I had booked before. I am a pregnant woman who flew in with my 7 year old daughter to the competition 10 times explained with a calm tone that I had specially booked a hotel specifically for 2 days in order to check in earlier in morning, for that he told me make a new reservation or he will call the police.

Broken down elevator all weekend long and the stairs were evidently not for patrons. They over booked themselves and therefore gave away several rooms of people we knew.

   The rooms felt very large, were clean and the beds were like sleeping on clouds! 

   The rest of the inside is very nice. We didn't have the chance to check out the pool or the fitness center, but we did have the complimentary breakfast and were impressed by it!

  I would gladly stay here again! There are also a lot of food options nearby if you don't want to stray too far from the hotel.",2021-07-12 14:42:46 UTC,5,5,2,9,OYM0SSbuqdbp5xlVcJpM5Q

I'm from Sacramento, CA and the rates here were about the same, but definitely what I would call overpriced for what I got, especially seeing as I've never run into these issues back home. To start, my room had not been adequately cleaned as there was a beauty blender left behind, tables had the last guest's meal remnants on it, among other things. There's a large mold spot on the bathroom ceiling, (room 236), I had to get different fresh towels as I could see hair and stains on them, the sheets had them as well. I stayed 8 days and asked to be moved on a day the hotel was less busy (it was always near if not at capacity). I was moved to room 424, nice view at night, but again, stains on the linen and hair on towels. The most disappointing part about this room was the bathroom. The tub was not properly cleaned so I had to go down and ask for cleaning supplies to do it myself, the shower curtain smelled a bit moldy as though it hadn't properly dried before being hung up and the water pressure was bad and the tub didn't drain properly so it fills up as you shower. Also the sprinkler in the ceiling wasn't securely in place so not sure if that's a hazard. Breakfast is quite lackluster: bars, oatmeal and yogurt, but it'll get you by. I absolutely ADORED all the staff I came across, but will not be looking to pay those rates for those rooms again. As I'm here due to a hospitalized family member it would've been nice if they would've offered a hospital rate on my room as I found out other hotels around here do, (I recommend Inn America, much better rates, even without hospital rate, as well as better reviews, breakfast, etc).

We were able to book for 3 ppl the same day but before 2pm. I texted the number on the website and they were very responsive and sent a link for payment but also accept Venmo and cash app. They sent directions and all the info via text which was great. It's a family owned business and the owners are extremely nice. 

When we got there a little after 7:30 they let us pick our bikes and gave us a water. They dont really fit the bike to you, so me and my husband both had to ask for adjustment, which they kindly did. Just be aware that if you are uncomfortable ask them for help. There was about 15-20 in the group. We left just a little after 8pm did a small loop to make sure everyone was ok then headed to the superdome, down poydras, carondelet, canal, then took a long break near bourbon. There were 2 escorts and they were constantly checking in to make sure we were ok. Then we rode down to the aquarium, along the river, through the French market and back up royal then home. We probably stopped 6+ times and the pace was pretty slow. We were home by 11:30 as promised. 

On the plus it was cool to be in a large group, we always wanted to be a part of the party. On the negative, it was overall a little disorganized. A few people controlled the music so it was hard to get a request in, I would have assumed they might have a standard upbeat playlist. Some people got lost  and we had to wait a while, but luckily the escort found them! 

If I did it again I would just get a group of my friends together and rent for $20 without the tour. Especially since we are local we have a good sense of where to go!",2021-03-21 15:51:43 UTC,4,0,0,1,Gdp73oY0xBwf0cwpIwJsLw

Laurel - Philadelphia,"Hotels, Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services",Mount Laurel,39.9263307602,-74.9565026954,3.5,32,AZ,We checked into this hotel at about 8:00 at night with two dogs and we're excited to finally rest after our long days drive. The hotel fee was $159 which was not bad considering we had the two dogs. You could see that the hotel was under renovation because the dining area had been torn apart and was in the process of being reconstructed. We asked about breakfast and they told us that they would be a bag breakfast. Now $159 for two dogs is not too expensive. However $159 for a hotel stay that has poor workmanship done in the newly renovated rooms is something else. We walked in the room and went to the bathroom we noticed that several of the newly installed floor tiles was missing grout and also loose and you can hear the hollow underneath it when you walked. We were excited to see the granite counters and coffee maker and including a large TV which was nice. The beds were very soft and comfortable which was a good experience and with the shades it was very dark when we went to bed which was very nice as well. However we noticed that in the closet the rack for luggage and clothes was not installed completely and was coming loose from the wall and we noticed that the toilet which had two options for flush one of the buttons did not work correctly. We noticed poor workmanship on the grout job and the tub and we also went to hang up our towel on the towel rack attached the door and lightly hanging the towel the rack completely came detached from the door. Overall it was a nice day and was quiet however there was a lot of things that would not finish or broken or poor workmanship on the contractor who they hired. So if you're going to pay $159 an experience poor workmanship in a room and not get a hot breakfast it's something to be concerned about if you you're staying for more than one night.,2021-09-24 20:34:53 UTC,2,1,0,3,NszqGHohbJej-P4Bki3leg

BIG MISTAKE! Once we arrived in the early evening, about 8:45, only two staff were working. There was only one group in front of me and it still took me 20 plus minutes to check in. Once we finally got our room keys, we walked into our room to collapse in exhaustion from our adventure only to find hair all over both beds in the room. Not only that, but toenail clippings and various types of stains all over the sheets. Trying to stay on the brighter side, we decided to go down and just get them to change the sheets. Again, after waiting about 15 minutes for the guy at the front desk to stop watching hotel guests walk down the hallways to go to the pool (commenting about their appearance and ogling as they walked by) I was finally met with annoyance that I needed new sheets. They gave me the sheets and said ""Sorry about that"". So here I am with my wife, making our own bed in a hotel. After we take off the duvet cover we found a yellow stain all over the underneath of it and throw it aside to only go down again and get a new cover. Still met with the same annoyance and apathetic tone. If we weren't so exhausted from driving 8 hours we'd say screw it and demand a refund.

The room did not look sanitized as there was dog hair on every surface especially the bath tub. I called the front desk to let them know and they said they would get someone to come and clean. I had to call 3 hours later because no one showed up and finally when someone did it was the same person who check us in. He had said they were understaffed and the housekeeping personnel was new and didn't know what they were doing. I voiced my concern many times and all I got was ""I'm sorry"".

If zero stars were available, I'd give it zero stars. 

The general manager blamed me for a problem Red Lion caused. 

There are many problems here. Please let me start from the beginning. 

1. The website said Red Lion had pet friendly rooms. When I called the motel to confirm that it was a pet friendly room, I was assured that it was.  

2. I called three times to confirm the room. They could not find my reservation at first. On the third call, they assured me that I was booked.

3. I arrive at the motel tired, distressed, and grieving because of a very, very difficult day/trip. I was not in good shape. Then I was told I did not have a room at all. I was angry. So, after waiting for at last 45 minutes, the front desk worked to get me a room. I appreciated that. I said I had a cat, so I needed a pet friendly room. Only then did they tell me ""pet friendly"" did not include cats. No one told me it did not mean cats.  NO ONE TOLD ME BEFORE THEN. There were no other options in the area, and I live 425 miles away. Who doesn't think ""pet friendly"" doesn't mean cats? They MUST be more specific than that!

4. I called the general manager, Tracey Fitzpatrick to try to explain what happened. At first I was calm. She made me wait for hours to speak to her. That was OK, and I was patient. But in the meantime, I wrote a review of the property based on my real experience of it. When I tried to talk to her she BLAMED ME. She got angry and said, ""Oh, I read your wonderful review. You know, this is my livelihood! You didn't even give me a chance to call you back."" I have no idea how reviews work, and I wrote it honestly because I don't want the same thing to happen to someone else. She handled it horribly. To blame a customer for mistakes the motel made is ridiculous. After she blamed me, I lost it, and I'm sorry, anyone would. I started out trying to gently explain ,and she threw gasoline on the fire. 

NONE of this is OK. NOT A SINGLE THING IS RIGHT HERE. They're calling me the bad guy when they destroyed my night, lied to me about the reservation, did not tell me about the cat policy, and then got angry when I was honest. 

What part of this says they are good at what they do? Nothing.

When I arrived in the UK to pick up the car, I was charged an additional 957 GBP for insurance. Unbelievable. I tried to discuss this matter with the attendant but got no real answer as to why the additional cost. It was indicated though that it would be refunded should I return the car undamaged - which it was...aside from the fact that the car I was loaned had dents, dings, and scratches from previous renters. I have since tried due recourse by going through customer service but was informed earlier that since my rental is closed, they will not refund me the money.  This is the most unethical company I have ever had the displeasure renting from. They clearly take advantage of foreign travelers. This is too large of a sum to write off.

Pros:
1) Quiet room (616) - hardly any noise
2) Front desk staff - very friendly
3) Wait staff - competent 
4) Location: numerous restaurants, 2 blocks from Reading Terminal Market, 4 blocks from Chinatown, Target and other department stores working walking distance

Cons:
1) Valet - too expensive: $56 per day; understaffed; no self parking; sometimes waited 30+ minutes for car
2) Called to have room cleaned - never cleaned
3) Gym: too small, but adequate if the number of people are few
4) A/C - really noisy; can't have it on while sleeping; lucky the temperature was not that high at night
5) Food - OK, recommend other places to eat

Overall: good hotel if it's under $200 per night.  Otherwise, there are numerous other hotels nearby",2021-08-09 13:07:07 UTC,3,0,0,0,PQ9Pi0Ak-Bys9Ju-n5xQ_w

Check in at the facility was super-easy; we were greeted by a friendly employee who had us sign the rental contract and provided a boat and waterway orientation.  We were provided with a chartlet of the waterways we were allowed to operate which made our boating day really simple.  They have coolers available and CLEAN, CLEAN, CLEAN bathrooms to use before you leave the dock.  Our boat was was a Bentley Pontoon boat, this thing was brand new and very nice.

Our stay in fact was a lovely one (though housekeeping could do a better job of vacuuming the carpet in central areas). 

Rather my review is regarding the valet (a black gentleman) who's name I did not catch, but he worked Monday and Tuesday during the day. My experiences with him were great. Nice guy, friendly, and polite, and always willing to lend a hand. Wonderfully service oriented, and truly an asset to the hotel.

Tuesday, after we checked out, we went out to our car that had been pulled up. We started to load the car when this lady (mid 20s, Caucasian) in a Toyota Corolla with PA plates pulls up. She gets out of the car, and asks the valet, the same black gentlemen, if she could park in the valet section of the hotel while she unloads her car. He asks her if she's a guest of the hotel. She says no, she lives across the street in The Girard apartments. He says no, that won't be possible as they will be busy all day and can't afford to have their hotel space used for any purpose other than valet.

The lady pretends not to hear, shuts off her car and begins to unload. She doesn't utter another word. In the meantime, the valet reminds her nicely that she cannot park there as she is not a guest. She does not respond and continues to make multiple trips from her car to the apt bldg unloading her car.

At this point I'm like ""oh hellllll no."" So I decide to observe. 

The valet goes into the apt bldg to have a word with their management or security, but she continues to resist. At this point I step in and politely say to the lady ""Miss, the gentleman works here and is doing his job. He has already nicely said that you cannot park there as it is interfering with his ability to do his job."" She looks at me and says ""mind your own business."" Oh Hell No.

At this point I say to her ""Really? In this day and age, is this the level of human decency you wish to display? Do you really want to be the next Karen?"" She says ""Get a life."" 

Well, I won't repeat the ""privilege"" that she presented at that moment in time, but at this point the Manager walks out along with the valet, the valet thanks me, and, despite being more than perturbed l, I've decided to walk away and leave.

This is the world we live in people. We, ALL, need to do better. And I thank this hotel's valet and manager that day for presenting themselves in a calm, professional manner to address this entitled individual who believes that the rules don't apply to her.",2021-07-07 18:43:33 UTC,4,0,0,0,D9o7QTSkb6sdXTp5HNiDJg

I've stayed at plenty of Philly hotels and the Canopy was one of the more pleasant stays. 

Pros: 
The location is probably the best thing. It is extremely central and everything is a few minutes walking distance. The decor of the hotel is very modern and beautiful, perfect for a backdrop. The room are cozy and nice, we took plenty of naps while we were there. The staff is also extremely nice and helpful if you need anything. The bar is also top notch, we had a couple of drinks there and loved it. 

Cons: 
Getting to the rooms can be confusing if you're on the 2nd floor (not sure if this is the case on other floors). The elevators bring you to an area full of conference rooms and the hotel rooms are through an unlabelled door, pretty confusing. There weren't any vents in the bathroom and our sink was slow to drain. There was only one staff member checking in people at 4pm (check-in time) so it was a long wait.

Every time I deal with a bad business I usually just shake it off and say well it's done and over with and move on. Well this place needs to be put on full blast. It should be closed down and never reopened. Basically the place is a bait and switch. There is a reason why they give you a low price. Because they are going to try 100 other avenues to charge you along the way and they will do it without your approval. They will force insurance on you, they will charge you for cleaning fee, they will lie about gas and dings on vehicle. You name it they will do their best to charge you. Keep receipts! But they will charge your more and say pay it or no car either way but at least you can tell your credit card company and let them fight it for you. Haven't even gotten to the part of the ignorant women behind the counter. They were bickering back and forth basically putting customers down while the lobby was packed like sardines. One lady kept saying the job sucks and it's not for the faint of heart. The other lady said not everyone can do that job and they need to hire some more people from New York, whatever that means. Well if you'd stop ripping people off, type the reservation number in and get the car I'd imagine the job isn't so difficult. Now I will admit I got angry after my 97 dollar rental somehow came to 258. So yea I can imagine you are gonna get questioned when you screw people over. I suggest those two women just quit and find something they won't stress so much over you're literally renting people cars what is so hard about that I see teenagers do it at REAL companies every day with smiles.

I booked through Expedia (so beware,) and was sent ""easy"" directions on how to get my rental. ""Just call the office when you arrive and we will come and pick you up,"" kind of thing. We called. We called for forty five minutes. It rang and rang and we never got a human being on the phone. Someone did finally arrive, and we went to the rental place. I stood in the lobby for ONE hour while ONE person worked to get people checked in, paperwork done, and went and retrieved each car. One by one. Finally another person came up and helped the line move. Either way, long wait after a long morning of traveling. The paperwork I never saw, I was told to sign on a digital pad, and was given an explanation of the paperwork, but never saw it myself. 
We get the car. It's smaller than expected and barely fit our luggage. It was not clean and smelled horrible. Made my little girl cough a bunch once inside. I was so tired of being there I just took and the car and left. 
We return the car a day early because the next day they weren't going to be open or have a shuttle for us back to the airport, again only explained AFTER we got there. The person there gives my husband major attitude and explains that he is NOT an authorized driver on the car, even after we went through all the paperwork, I got his license to add him, all of that, this person never even added him on the car. Apparently. She lectures him the entire time, saying he's not an authorized driver no less than 17 times. Then she tells him that he needs to have CLEANED THE CAR before returning it. Now, there was nothing left in the car other than the sand we picked up during our week at the beach. Not buckets of sand, just sand. When we left the only thing they said was that we needed to bring the tank back half full. We brought it back more than that, and A DAY EARLY. The person said they were going to charge us a CLEANING FEE. Never in my life have I ever had to clean a car before returning it to a rental car place. And never in my life will I EVER use Easirent for a rental car EVER again. I'd rather pay more for less of a hassle.

My husband was stuck on the side of the road for hours until someone finally showed up to remove him for the area that he was at. He was supposed to be towed 60 miles from where he was stopped at but he was only towed for 5 miles and was left there. When I called to let them know that we were supposed to be towed 60 miles from where we were left the dispatch lady stated the driver was on his way to Atlanta and there were no more trucks to come and pick us up and to call in the morning to talk to the manager. After speaking to my husband's company, Tow pro charged my husband's company the total price of the 60 miles when we were only towed 5 miles. Let me also not forget that the driver put my husband and my life in danger. He told us to sit in my husband's truck while it was being towed the 5 miles. The driver also lied about several things that happen during the event of the tow. When I called the Tow Pro about the incident the lady put me hold first to get her boss and then when the manager which is a guy got on the phone he was so rude to me. He was so unprofessional and did not listen to anything. He had the audacity to call me a liar because I was explaining what happen. He told me that he worked with his driver for 10 plus years and that his driver had no reason to lie. Ok Tow Pro think about this if the receipt said that you towed someone 60 miles when you only towed them 5 miles. You said that you did 450 dollars worth of work on the truck but you did show that on the invoice. WHO LIED? WHO IS THE LIAR? Then the manager told me that he can change the receipt so that it will match what the driver is trying to say. Really? My husband and the company already has the original receipt so you changing it after the event has taken place is a forging. So that is telling me that the whole company is full of liars. The dispatch tell you one thing then the driver shows up hours later or don't even show up. The driver lies about his instructions, his distance, and what he has done.

There are no amenities other than a restaurant on site (Wayward), and that its connected to Federal Donuts next door. Detailed review below:

Parking: there are options with varying prices close by. The Lowes hotel is $55/60 a night across the st but think priority goes to their guests. Canopy does have valet for around the same price as well. We opted to self park at the East Market Parking Garage which was across the street next to the pet/vet place. $35 per night. Another night we found a garage next to Jefferson hospital and a coupon online which brought the rate down to $18 per night, but was a 4-5 minute walk from the hotel.

Hotel: the king standard was on the ninth floor and we had the curtains drawn almost the entire time so the view didn't matter. There are I believe 12 floors of which PH is 12. The ceilings are so tall, and the property itself is beautiful and swanky. The room is modest and quite tight but was just enough for our stay. The bathroom, thankfully was larger than most other hotels and came in handy with our toddler.

Covid: masks were not worn by all staff members. Since housekeeping is only on demand, we did ask for towels and toiletries a few times which was fine. We communicated via the Hilton Honors app and I believe it was with front desk. 

Diamond status - we are Hilton Diamond members and  there was no upgrade offered upon mobile check in. We received $24 daily credit for use at the Wayward (honestly cant get much of a breakfast let alone a meal for 2). We ended up ordering bottled juices just to spend the credit and interestingly enough one day the juices were 10oz (tiny) and the next to was 16.5... strange...

Some items to note - the valet staff were not attentive at all thru our 3 night stay. I'm not one to fuss but when they're standing and poking at their phones at the valet booth, at least help us press the button to open the doors for us if you see that we are schlepping a stroller, young child, umbrella, bags etc. Just looking for basic courtesy. On the flip side, we did mobile check in which helped us bypass the front desk interaction and using your phone you unlock the hotel room/activate elevator. You can literally check in and out with zero human interaction. The hotel room has switches and outlets in particular the bed frame which our toddler loved switching on and off all night long. How awesome for a good night's rest!",2021-08-02 15:17:51 UTC,4,2,1,2,eyzKXX6WTizrgNSBRI4JCg

The ""manager"" told us that none of the tolls are manned and we would be fined 25.00 for each toll we went through. So we decided we better get the sun pass. We went through 2 tolls, both had people working. So we basically gave Easirent 55.00 free! We got a car which on the first day the malfunction light came on.

From the moment I called from the airport to inquire about an early checkin to checkout, I felt as though the staff here actually cares about the customer. After checking in early, we were given a lovely corner room with everything you could need. The rooms are very stylish with unique touches everywhere. Beds are really comfortable with nice linens. The entire place was spotless and all staff wearing masks following the guidelines of the state mask mandate. A short while after checkin, I received a text from Destinee at the front desk to make sure everything was to our liking. It's these small attentions to detail that really can make a difference in a stay, coffee in the room was a Nespresso which makes superb coffee. There is also an option to get a small breakfast bag delivered to the room, which we did not take advantage of. Throughout the two days we had occasional texts from Destinee just making sure everything was satisfactory. Very nice...
Location is very central to everything in Center City and walking distance to most everything. I have stayed in over ten hotels in Philly and I must say this is by far my bes5 stay so far.

us and said they were here first so the driver would pull up to us but instead he pulled up close to another group who should have been after us and they basically jumped into the van in front of us.

Location: Located about 25 minutes from the airport, the Canopy is in the heart of South Philly, just steps away from Market. During the day it seems respectable, however don't venture out after dark if you're not used to seeing certain activities taking place (if you get my drift). 

Hotel: Rooms are nice and modern with a retro feel. However no microwaves or mini fridges and the sinks drain very slowly (apparently ""that's how they be"" and can't be fixed). Bathrooms are a nice size, great water pressure in the showers, and the beds were soft and comfy- especially nice if you're dealing with jet-lag. However, be careful in the shower as there was no anti-slip protection in ours and I almost fell the first night (I did report it through text and received no acknowledgment of that).

Staff: Staff was great. Everyone was kind, responsive, and helpful. They texted me several times throughout the stay and responded immediately, however as mentioned above, there was no acknowledgement to the report of almost slipping in their shower and the suggestion to install anti-slip protection.

I did a two night staycation here and would gladly go back. There were a few hiccups but nothing that tarnished the experience. Let me begin: 

Parking: very confusing. I ended up going to a garage on sansom and probably paid more than the valet would have been. Don't be like me. 

Room: it was small upon entry. I also noticed hair on the pillows and duvet and sent a text to the front desk to let them know I would like to move. They switched me to a room that was bigger, brighter and much cleaner. I will say the sink was slow draining which was a minor annoyance. I loved the Art Deco vibes and the art work reminded me of Basquiat which was very cool ! 

Due to my parking woes I left my ID in the car but because I was a Hilton honors member they verified me at the front desk with other information so I was able to check in with no hassle ! 

The updates to contact-less visits are great, the staff checked on me continuously via text which was sweet. I did need more body wash towards the last day and was promptly delivered it once I sent the text. 

The area was a highlight for me: there's a target 2 blocks down, a cozy grocery/convenience store on the corner and tons of shops one block over on Market st. 

If you're looking for a place to stay-cay locally I would def recommend ! I didn't check the restaurant out but I can't wait to go back and indulge because it looked very promising.",2022-01-16 18:36:17 UTC,4,0,0,0,_a_8zr_iIoS-GXzt62Ovkg

We really enjoyed our stay! The room was such a vibe! (All of the exclamation marks reflect how much I loved it lol) 
The hotel was like 4.5 stars rounded up and the reason why is because we had to call down to the front desk for items. They didn't give us an issue about it but still it was a bit of a wonder why if two people or more were going to be in a room why more than one of some items weren't provided. Also in the package we were expecting some items to be included so already in the room but we had to call for that too. The parking package came in handy but it was a bit confusing at first because the valet wasn't really aware and then we had to explain to them it was included then go to check it out with the hotel. Maybe the hotel should provide the valet with a list of people who purchase that kind of hotel/parking package in the future... That would be a bit helpful for the guests. None of that took away from the stay however. If you're into art details it was tidbits of it all throughout the hotel. From the   giant gold record in the elevator to the cassette tape collage painting on our floor. A art collection of purses in the lobby and an ensemble of trinkets in the lobby front desk.

I was there for a business meeting. Several things went wrong. We were told the wrong room in our initial reservation. Breakfast was over an hour late. This was very embarrassing as we were hosting a meeting for clients. When breakfast finally did arrive. We had to ask several times for proper accompaniments with the coffee service (like milk!!!) which was not initially provided.  Cream cheese was also not provided, although bagels were served. Again, we asked several times for cream cheese and it never came.  Toaster was not working. Asked about this as well and it was never replaced or fixed. 

On a personal note.  My credit was charged twice for the room. I called for a refund and was given the run-around. Initially the refund was issued on a Mastercard which was an error because I paid with a Visa.  When I called again to resolve the matter. They claimed it was ""just how their receipts are done."" I suspect there is some kind of credit card fraud going on at this hotel. I would urge management there to look into it.  After I called again and again, finally my credit card was refunded correctly, but only after I asked to speak to the Front Office Manager at the location. I was supposedly transferred to the Front Office Manager but I was diverted to a voicemail which I'm not certain was his at all. I nevertheless left a message but never received a call back.

Geico scheduled this service to pick up my car that was wrecked at the Nashville airport.  As I mentioned it was a long day for most tow companies and the wait was astronomical so Geico sent out another company.  Long story short""ish"" my car was still not at the repair shop on 2/26.  I contacted Geico and they reached out to the tow company. They contacted the first company instead of the one that actually had my car. This is where everything went down hill.  Tyler from Geico called me with Amber K. On the line. Amber was extremely rude from the word go. I was trying to explain that I had received a text message regarding my car. She thought the best customer service response was to speak over me and continuously interrupt. It got to the point that Tyler and I both questioned why she was being so rude. Well not my finest hour I got ticked off and said ""b$&@ just do your job and find my car.  Amber didn't like being spoken to with the same energy she put out so she hung up. Plot twist! She called me over 31 times from a blocked number. She called me a cunt, said my children were stupid and that I should not be allowed to have children. She spewed some stupidity about my mom.  She also stated that she had my address and was coming to f me up. On that note I told her to come right on but she would leave in a bag because threatening my home wasn't the way to go. She called repeatedly. I called the office twice  on that day and told them that Amber was calling me. First time I was told she got off at 3:30p so basically nothing they could do. Second time I was told the person who answered the phone didn't have her cell number. I could have helped her out there because I then started getting text from Amber.  The company has yet to call me back. So my only recourse was to write this review and file a complaint with Geico. The day after the ice storm Amber posted this little gem on Facebook so I thought I would let all you Nashville and Memphis drivers know that you are getting in her nerves.",2021-03-01 13:27:02 UTC,1,0,0,0,CdlojyAD5-7LD9Xn-59v7A

My girlfriend booked a room at La Quinta Inn 7500 US HWY 19 N. on June 16th.

When we arrived in our new room I checked my credit card statement to see that I was charged for the the room I was just turned away from. I have spent countless time calling the hotel and getting the run around on why I have not received a refund, the owner is never there, never available, his brother passed away, etc, etc. This is absolutely ridiculous to wait 4 months for a refund for a room we never stayed in!

But my feline nature reared up and the curiosity started gnawing at the back of my mind.
The Odette's valet was very courteous and friendly - downright chipper, actually. He even offered to wipe down the front of my interior because I didn't shut my window all the way and some rain got in. I apologized as I exited the vehicle, and he offered. Was a nice touch. And for someone with a '13 Elantra, that felt bourgeoise in a good way. Heheh.

The interior design is what was meant as a thoughtful mix of contemporary, mid-century, and farmhouse. Sounds like an odd mix but it works; at least for now. For a restaurant with high traffic, the surfaces seem to lend themselves well to frequent cleaning - and clean they did. At no point during my wait did I not see a human cleaning *something* - from the bannisters to chair rails to surfaces of side tables. That in itself made me feel comfortable in this COVID-era. The lighting is warm and inviting on a gloomy day, but I could easily see how vibrant it would feel at night.

That being said, this place really is unique. Airy. Well-lit. Friendly. I had checked out the menus online before leaving the house. The drink prices are outrageous, but you're not paying for the peach schnapps in your Bellini - you're paying for the service, the friendly tone, the feeling you're supposed to gain by the sheer experience of arriving. The food listed on the breakfast and brunch menus weren't as ground-breaking as I had imagined, with all of the build-up and the constant promotion of the luxe-ness of it all. As Peter Griffin would say, it insists upon itself. So we opted to wait for lunch, and we were pleased with that choice.

I can't complement our server highly enough. Jesse, who only just started serving two weeks ago, started here as a busser four months ago. This charming lad had a great sense of humor, about the music, the COVID restrictions, the menu, etc. He has one of those effortless-banter types of personalities that make diners feel at ease, and he will do well if he stays in this industry. He even alerted us that he overcharged us by accident for the parking, noting that arrivals before 3PM are $5 instead of the usual $20. I had already tabbed out but he had a manager override it because he didn't want us overcharged. Little things like that matter, particularly when two parties had two cars involved, and for an establishment as unabashedly pricey as this.

My friend had the Short Rib au-jus sandwich ($18), and I had the Lobster Roll ($22) with a side salad. Both dishes were pristine (and hers had their famous truffle fries, which were wonderful - not too heavy on ""canned"" truffle flavor). The salad, which was underdressed, was the perfect backdrop to the lobster salad, as I'm trying to be carb-conscious these days, and I scooped most of the lobster onto said salad. We opted for sugar-friendly maritinis with fresh lime as opposed to the cocktails listed on the menu - all looked amazing, but most heavy on the sugar. The drinks are what kill ya, price wise. 

We were full and pleased and loving all the things - our great meal, lovely river view, and lively server, as well as the fairly empty dining room. Would we go every weekend? No. Will it stay in my mix? Yes.",2021-03-29 22:46:55 UTC,4,0,0,1,g8l-fuuFp92Tb3ldWeBnXw

Made a reservation for 10am at the Santa Barbara airport. I arrived at 10 am but was told there was no car available and I would have to wait 45 min.  The guy at the desk was unapologetic and said to try another company.  I walked to the others, found nothing, so went back to the counter and told him since I didn't have a choice, I would wait.  He then told me 2 other people had come after me and I would now have to wait for them to get cars.  I told him that wasn't fair, you're the one that sent me to those other places after I'd already checked in to pick up my rental.  He said he wasn't going to argue with me, maybe I was there and maybe I wasn't.  I could not believe what I was hearing.  He was so rude and in my book he'd just called me a liar.

Once I got the car I had to find an employee so I could document that the fender had a huge scratch on it.  I didn't want to get blamed for that.

I reserved a full size car but was given a Toyota Camry.  I needed room for 4 suitcases.  The trunk on this car only fit 2 so I had to put stuff on the back seat.

The Peppermill has also made a point to set the standard when it comes to rake. Over the last decade, they have constantly been the cheapest at the $5 blind level.

What a BIG mistake to stay here. Service was horrible and completely disappointing. The Friday afternoon check in girl, also our Tuesday afternoon check out person, was the only nicest person.

Highlight - free breakfast every morning and flavored creamer. Felt bad for the cook because he serviced the entire hotel by himself, with a group of 40 a few days. Completely inefficient way to handle this, as well as getting any toiletries and towel service.

I've read the other reviews and feel compelled to tell the truth.  My wife and I are loyal restauranteurs and are experts on every restaurant in the area. Why do we go here many times a month?  First, the people are fantastic. I can't say enough about the staff. Always upbeat, attentive, and caring.  Do they get busy sometimes?  Yes they do (every establishment is short-handed, you know that).  The food is excellent and they keep making it better. We tried everything.  We rarely eat red meat and there's ample selections for us.  The appetizers are so plentiful that we can only order one. Never had a bad one and if we did they would happily replace it. Who goes to a nice restaurant and eats a meal they don't like?  Only people who want to write a poor review.  Every excellent restaurant I've been to has always accommodated or taken if off the menu.  I can only remember sending something back once and that was because I ordered the wrong item.   The price point is higher than most but the ambiance is the best.  Now let's talk valet.  I understand they had to build an overflow parking lot.  Parking is horrible in New Hope, so I understand the dilemma.  All lots are a minimum of $10 and don't have valet, so for us, it's worth it.  So, if you want a fun time, great bar, quality entertainment, really nice food, and want to meet really cool people, this is the place.  We are here often because we love the place. 
Finally, we are locals yet numerous friends have stayed at the hotel and absolutely love it. Many have reported dancing all night on The Roof, a must if you stay here.  Oh, it's the place to be seen in New Hope (or New Hollywood as it's referred to these day).   There's nothing even close.",2021-12-03 22:19:52 UTC,5,0,0,0,WMxafN2IlVgTvgRY0hyRnw

While visiting Nashville, we dropped by not once, but TWICE for a few pints. I wanted to work my way through their huge offering of big, bold IPAs. There were two IPAs on their menu that really stood out to me, Leonidas and Fennario. These two had lots of hoptastic flavor and were very smooth. While I do enjoy a juicy/fruity IPA in the summer, these two offered a more clean IPA flavor profile for the chilly months. Drinker beware, the Fennario is 7.2% and really sneaks up on you. 

In addition to the IPAs, we sampled the Brew Walker and Chai Walker beers. Both had a delicious mapley coffee taste and we would make the perfect winter drinks. Thankfully they also had Frothy Monkey cold brew on draught as we were in town for the Nashville Rock n' Roll half marathon and i knew I would need a little prerace pick me up. The bartender was nice enough to let me purchase a water bottle fill of the cold brew. If you haven't had this coffee before, definitely put it on your list. Jackalope Brewing Company uses it in the Brew Walker and Chai Walker beers and it's probably because it has such an amazing flavor. 

Last two things I'd like to to dote on in Jackalope Brewing Company. First is the ambiance. Is it a tad confused? Sure. They call the location The Ranch, yet it's beach themed, and... in the middle of Tennessee? Ok. Lots of things didn't add up from a theme standpoint, but I honestly LOVED it. I thought it was bright and clean. It was impossible to be sad while sitting amidst the brightly painted walls. Finally, the merch. Take my money Jackalope Brewing Company. After a few of those Fennario's my credit card was burning a hole in my pocket. The branding on all of their merch was SO cool. I ended up buying a tshirt and a running hat. The teal running hat is now a staple piece of my wardrobe.

This brewery is a little farther away from the touristy stops in Nashville. Definitely worth the Uber.",2021-12-13 22:28:40 UTC,5,2,3,2,MBwpaYiqkTJjhgTwalGsOg

If you like a gorgeous and modern hotel, some incredible views, and a top-notch restaurant than, boy oh boy, have I got the place just for you! The River House at Odettes is located in quaint, quiet, and historical New Hope, Pennsylvania. When my wife and I drove down to the hotel, the streets of New Hope were more crammed with visitors than the Seaside Heights Boardwalk on a sunny summer day! New Hope is a special place to visit with your entire family.
The River House at Odettes (Hotel Review):
The River House at Odettes is only about a year old as of the beginning of July 2021. It is a modern piece of architecture beautifully hand crafted from a wooden frame. The hotel itself is situated right on the banks of the scenic Delaware River. Even the panoramic view pulling into the parking garage takes one's breath away. Professional valet parking awaits you. From there, you head up the elevator (or the stairs) to the first floor in order to check in.
The front desk hotel staff is cheery and welcoming. The main lobby is a marble and wooden masterpiece with large bay windows overlooking the Delaware. Our premium suite was on the second floor, and I have to say our room was one of the most beautiful that I have ever stayed in. Our detached living room was as large as any living room in my own home. During the colder months, you even have your very own fireplace that lights up on command. Our front deck was huge (there is a deck off the bedroom too) and the vista overlooking the Delaware River and the surrounding Pennsylvania Mountains are absolutely incredible.
Our suite was not cheap by any means. We did get to see some of the smaller rooms on our floor, and they looked simply fine if that is your thing. Not all rooms come with a beautiful walk out deck but many of the regular rooms still overlook the scenic Delaware. So, all in all I award a 5-diamond rating to the River House at Odettes Hotel. It is a place you will just have to put on your radar for the future.
The River House Restaurant at Odettes (Restaurant Review):
During the evening we went (July 4th in fact), the dining room was under the command of Chef Nathan Kasubick. It was my birthday dinner from my wife, so I was really looking forward to a special meal. And, believe me, we got it!
The restaurant itself is quite beautiful and our table faced out overlooking the Delaware River. The ambiance and the décor of the place is colorful and enjoyable to the eye.  A lot of modern art deco paintings grace almost every wall. Nearby, in another room, is a well-dressed piano bar and the singer who was playing his acoustic guitar was piped into the dining room. It was quite nice and not overly loud or disturbing. The singer had an incredibly gentle and soothing voice too.
Before long, we were greeted by our wonderful waitress as well as Chef Nathan. The service was some of the best I have ever experienced in a hotel restaurant. As I looked around at everyone else on the staff, it was clear they all were on the same page. Believe me, I have been to so many restaurants where you think you are actually being served by The Three Stooges or the Keystone Cops!
Lynne and I ordered a beautiful and delicious bottle of New Zealand Pinot Noir ($75) to start out our meal. My first appetizer course was the escargots ($18) with anchovy paste, toasted pine nuts with a cashew and garlic butter. I told Chef Nathan later on that the escargots were completely submerged in the butter sauce itself and could not be seen. You kind of had to search for the snails themselves but other than that the taste of them was enjoyable. Lynne started out with a romaine heart Caesar salad ($16) with focaccia croutons and shaved parmesan. A traditional and classic Caesar salad does not come with cherry tomatoes on it but this one did. Still, Lynne enjoyed her salad very much. Chef Nathan then surprised me with an appetizer of smoked brook trout ($18) with pimento cheese and some delectable homemade focaccia bread for dipping. The dip itself was quite heavy with an over-abundance of cream cheese, so I suggested to Chef Nathan that he should make the trout the real star of the dish in the future. One thing he did accomplish was removing every single pin bone from of the trout. Remarkable accomplishment!
For our main courses, I had the most delicious and succulent seared diver scallops ($42) with fresh green curry, baby spinach, coconut milk with roasted peanuts and fish sauce. Chef Nathan promised they were real diver scallops, and they absolutely were! This may have been the best scallop dish that I have eaten in 15 years and please do not ask me what happened 15 years ago! My wife had the sweet and sour shrimp ala plancha ($39) with charred baby Bok choy. For your information, Plancha is a Spanish term for barbecuing or cooking at an extremely high temperature.

Like most places these day the struggle to find staff has put a strain on service but our server Kelly was top notch! While the clam chowder was epic, the tomato soup was being asked to do more than be a great tomato soup. Sometimes it's best to do less with great ingredients than more and I felt they were trying to elevate the dish to a level that it was only destined to fail at, basically it tasted like herbs and spices flavored with tomato, thankfully the accompanying grilled cheese struck that perfect balance of be a classic sandwich yet the flavors and textures were confident enough to say ""this isn't your mom's grilled cheese but it is the one you wish she made"".

Now the restaurant...First, our server spent at least 10 minutes chatting with people at a table and walking away before returning & stating ""I did not know you were my table""  I am sorry, but if that server had worked for my first chef I apprentice with, they would have been give their walking papers, ....where was the management directing staff?  

On to the food....cheese board...are you kidding me?  Kraft cheddar cheese, supper market brie & a goat cheese....was that really goat?  And they bring out enough to feed 4 people....It was only for myself & my wife.  I would rather have had less cheese of better quality. What about some of the wonderful local cheese companies....Bobolink, or Jasper Hill for REAL Vermont cheddar.

I ordered the Short Rib Lollipop...nice presentation....short rib meat wrapped & tied around a pork rib bone.  Tender, but dry.  Why wasn't the braising liquid reduced and included in the presentation?  I had to wash it down with wine because of the dryness.  

My wife's shrimp gratin was Welsh Rarebit on toast with shrimp added....and I have had much better Welsh Rarebit.

I could go on, but to say, we will not come again, with so many better and wonderful restaurants in the river towns of NJ & PA.  Not a way to celebrate our anniversary that should have had a wonderful memory of wonderful food & wine.

Sadly they still are having issues and we left somewhat disappointed.

The Good: The location. You can't beat the view of the river and the space is beautiful. The staff was also very friendly and professional but they seemed spreed to thin and need more staff.

The bad: They still are deeply struggling with the bar and getting wine up from the wine cellar in a timely manner. We ordered an expensive bottle of red wine to go with our entrees once our apps were served. no wine until to half way through our entrees. This is completely not ok. If you're going to spend over $100 on a bottle of wine you want to be able to actually enjoy it WITH you meal!

The food was also just ok. My parents had the mussels and the seafood platter which they enjoyed. My onion soup was just ok. The broth was a little bland and the onions not as caramelized as they could have been and the cheese was also somewhat bland. My father and I had the duck. It was fairly fatty and needed some kind of sauce of something to give it some flavor. It was also overly salty. For the price point I expected something more memorable. I'm surprised the menu hasn't changed since we were here in October. With the amazing farms in the this area I'm completely shocked that they are not using all the fresh, local and SEASONAL options in the region! No specials or anything like that. With all of the amazing restaurants in New Hope/Lambertville this place really needs to up their food game. 

Finally, as others have said it is completely absurd and insulting to have to pay $20 to valet your car when you have no other option and you've just spent over $400 on dinner. It makes guests feel taken advantage of and leaves a horrible taste in ones mouth as they leave as their last impression of the restaurant. 

Sadly, unless I hear that the food program has been completely revamped I'm not sure its worth our time or money to try this place again.",2021-04-21 14:51:16 UTC,2,1,0,7,Ws5h2Y8T0BPfd44W87VBCg

Mary Ann, who performs everything from front desk and manager duties, to occasional cooking duties for the morning breakfast buffet. I engaged with her from my initial reservations to my final checkout. She is very professional, patient and cooperative, plus she has a great sense of humor. 
 
Brandon, who checked me in and also helped me with advice on local places to eat, for my first-ever trip to Boise, Idaho.

Rebecca, who runs the morning front desk and was unfailingly polite and friendly, even at the early hours.

Molly, who cooks and maintains the breakfast buffet, which was always excellent.

All of these folks made my stay for a business trip quite enjoyable. In fact the only improvement I would make relates to storage space. Since the closet is somewhat small, and there are no drawers, it would be nice if a luggage rack/stand was provided, maybe small enough to fit in the closet. As a single traveler, I just put my suitcase on one of the desk areas and kept things like socks and t-shirts in it, while hanging up other clothing items. This would have been difficult if I had been travelling with my wife.

I am truly surprised Marriott allows this property to be part of the Courtyard brand. The room quality was worse than even any motel I've stayed at. The room they first gave me was extremely dirty, during COVID times! Dirty towels hanging in closet, underwear sticker on wall, stains all over wall and floor, greasy fingerprints on phone, cockroach in light fixture... clearly wasn't cleaned other than a made bed. I went to the front desk to complain, had to wait behind another party complaining about the exact same situation. I was moved to a new room. The new room was better, but not great. There were some sort of bug feces behind the toilet, disconnected doorknob, and stains on the carpet. I realized at this point that my room wasn't a one-off, it is the hotel. The rooms are dirty, extremely dirty, and dimly lit. I would never come back unless renovated.

Now the front desk was polite when I raised the issue. Like I mentioned, they moved me to a different room and comped me one night. However, later that night they woke me girlfriend and I by calling me at midnight to again apologize. What hotel doesn't have the common decent sense to not call a guest at midnight?? This ruined the entire evening of sleep. Between that midnight call and the clear lack of any cleaning, I have given the service a poor rating.

This is a fairly new Holiday Inn Express. It was so nice!!!! Very modern and clean! Hand sanitizers were available and signs to wear masks were all throughout the building. Check in was easy and they do have a parking garage for $20 that was a lifesaver for me! No scraping windshields and digging my car out from the snow. They also have a parking lot right next to the main entrance. I tried to swipe my room key at the parking garage to get out. It didn't work so hit the Intercom button and that worked. 

The room had a nice view of Lucas Oil Stadium. Some restaurants that are close are Tavern on South - they have a great heated covered balcony that's big!!! They also offer 10% off for guests of the Holiday Inn. They had a menu as well as Iozzo's Garden of Italy. I didn't see those last night. I would've ordered from one of them. Chef JJ's Downtown, and the Slippery Noodle Inn are all very close to this hotel. White Castle, Arby's and Subway are also close. It's hard to find places for dinner when conditions are like this and you're stuck. Hopefully these restaurants will help someone find a place to eat. Tavern on South is directly next to The Holiday Inn Express. 

The room was big. It had a king sized bed, a huge floor length mirror, flat screen TV, a nice area to plug in your cell phone or electronic devices, a couch, desk chair with a desk, a nice little nook with a Keurig, a microwave, and a refrigerator.

The bathroom had a really nice walk in shower. They had JR Watson shampoo, conditioner, and body wash in the shower. All were great!! They had a hairdryer as well FYI. They do have a breakfast but due to Covid you walk up to a table and look on the list provided and a employee will grab the items and put them in a bag for you. No hot items right now. I'm thankful they had breakfast at least.  I got cereal, orange juice, milk, and yogurt. 

They have a fitness center as well as a swimming pool. They have a nice little market by the front desk as well as ice machines and vending machines on every level. They also have a lobby with a tv and couches and chairs on the first floor.

Biden, Jr. Railroad Station, is quite a pretty Station, and a historic one to boot. It is modeled after the train stations of the 19th century to demonstrate America's strength during the Industrial Age. Now it serves as a reminder to what a great country this country once was.

With over 100 trains passing through daily, it is clean, easy to navigate, and the drop off and pick up zones are easy to get to and easy to pick up from. The waiting area is also well designed in such a way that you are not on top of each other. There is also a bus station across the street that you can take a bus to Dover, and during high season, out to the beaches.

I really like this station. In fact, I remember when they changed the name of it to reflect then Vice President Biden's regular usage of Amtrak. It really is one of the nicer stations on the Northeast Corridor outside of the major ones like 30th St and Union Station.

I moved out here from San Diego around August 2019, and hoped to find a good poker room that I could call ""home"". I immediately went to Peppermill upon moving to NV and fell in love with the staff, the poker action and the locals. Good people, great poker and awesome drinks! What else could you ask for? During this pandemic Peppermill has done a wonderful job at ensuring our safety by strictly enforcing mask wearing policies and cleaning the plexiglass at the table on a regular basis.  Thank you to Rena, an amazing poker floor manager, and the rest of the Peppermill staff for making this my go-to poker room in Reno, NV!!

I booked here because I needed to be in town for work nearby and travel with my dog as well as another dog that I was dog-sitting for, and this was the only pet-friendly hotel in the area. My initial experience was a little rough at checkin, as the front desk clerk sent me to the wrong building to find my room (where I encountered a crack-head coming down stairs who wanted to pet my puppy) - the clerk later redeemed herself by taking me directly to my room and helping me get in. But, back to the hotel conditions, there was a layer of grime on everything at this hotel. I had to bust out the Lysol wipes on surfaces in my room, and they came away nasty. I had to ask the front desk for a vacuum, because there were little silica balls all over my floor and my puppy kept trying to eat them. They supplied me a carpet cleaner that did have a bleach solution in it and I used it but I still had to pick up all the silica balls myself because the carpet cleaner couldn't get into the corners where the balls were. The photos of my room tell the story of how rough this place was. And this was AFTER I cleaned it.  The curtains are stained, the shower walls are stained, the air vents are gross, and on and on. 
So, beyond the nasty room conditions, this hotel is situated on the corner of two high-traffic roads. I heard motorcycles and sirens and loud mufflers ALL NIGHT LONG for three nights. My white noise on my phone couldn't drown it out.  And every time someone went in or out of their room, the doors slam closed which set off the dogs barking. And one night, the room next to me was engaging in sexual acts on and off all night long . I woke up around midnight and again at 5am because my bed was shaking due to their activities on the other side of the wall. Ugh.  Word of advice - go find another pet friendly hotel. There is a brand new Hampton Inn opening next week behind this hotel that will be dog friendly. Go stay there, because this dump was not cheap either $80+/night when this is a $40+ hotel. I did check the mattress, thankfully it was in good condition and was comfortable if I didn't have all the other distractions keeping me awake.

EDIT:  only a few of my photos seem to be visible attached the this review. Go look at the photos for the hotel on this page. I give a description for each of what's wrong.   Stains on curtains, windowsill falling apart, nasty air vents, stains on TV stand, stains on shower walls, no tissue, phone in room didn't work, nasty window, someone else hair on the toilet, someone else's hair product still in bathroom on floor by the toilet, no duvet cover on the duvet, oh and how could I forget???

He hardly acknowledged us. Forgot to bring our wine, passed our table several times not once asking if we needed anything. I had to stop him just to have a refill in water. I did not expect this from a high end high rating place. On top of that gratuity was added to my meal, when specifically on the menu it said a party of 6 and more will add gratuity.

We have been to Spinners several times before, and this time was an epic fail, for the most part.  The restaurant has been refreshed, which is an improvement from our pre-pandemic visit, but the carpenter missed some issues that should have been addressed, though minor, make the remodel uncomplete.
We arrived 10 minutes before our reservation - seated within 2 minutes of our appointed time.  It took 20 minutes to have our drink order taken, which is a gross issue, when you are advertised as a high-end restaurant.  The server must have told the manager that we were unhappy, as he came to the table and said he was going to comp the drinks because of the poor service (did not happen).  My steak was to be medium, came out rare... and cold. 
 It took so long to get it, that I was afraid to send it back.
What to watch for:  The mains do not come with sides.  You pay extra for any sides, and they are not cheap.  The tab has a ""payment"" charge  - What is that?  Though we love this restaurant, this visit has us not wanting to return.  A $52.00 steak with no sides is way out there... 
Management... get your act together or you will have ""one visit clients"" and bad reviews will continue.  In today's environment, this cannot be be acceptable to gain new business.",2021-09-10 13:21:22 UTC,1,0,0,0,HB55pvp38wzxlpORMyxuow

Unfortunately we were told the reservations had already booked those all for the evening...we'll be fact checking this later BTW.

We were seated with an excellent view at a stationary bar table and the wait staff was prompt with getting drinks in hands quickly. Of note, the Mai Tai was pretty good. Ordered the grouper blackened and thought all was well with the world. I was grossly mistaken. The grouper came out and appeared to have been glazed vs blackened. And then upon consuming said fish, I'm honestly still not entirely convinced it *was* grouper vs some other type of white fish. The sprig of broccoli and two bites of rice were disappointing as well. 

Then upon finally getting up to leave over an hour after arriving, there were still several of the tables on the spinning portion curiously vacant. This creates many questions. The primary one being...why couldn't we have used one of those tables? Did they have a bunch of reservations cancel? If so, why didn't they offer to seat us there after we got drinks and before we ordered meals? If not, do they not know how to stagger seat people efficiently around reservations? Regardless, the food & not getting a table on the spinning portion were disappointing. 

Would I come back? Pretty unlikely. Especially given the pricing to food value ratio being pretty poor. There were just too many other restaurants on the water with good views, better food, and at a better value. I guess if you are going to come eat here, despite the food quality & price, make sure you get a reservation in advance.",2021-12-05 01:46:44 UTC,2,0,0,0,l0xjIcSaATUzwR-03bfvEA

We checked the web site and it looked like a great place.

We were very excited right up until we exited the elevator to a wall of sound. 

Small extremely loud and greeted two young hostesses. One was rather rude the other quiet. We arrived on time for our reservation and were told our table was not ready. We asked for directions to the ladies room and were rudely told just walk that way and you will find it. We came back to the hostess stand after finding the ladies room and after a while our table was finally ready. The quiet hostess lead the way. 

After another wait we met our waitress, she literally has to yell her name and asked if we wanted to order a drink and when we asked for the drink she rudely replied yelling we do NOT have that and do not have any apple to make it! 

We asked for options for champagne and she said rudely yelling I can get you a Prosecco...  

We agreed and she stomped off...

While we sat trying to hear each other we decided this is not anything like we expected a decided to leave. 

We stopped by the hostess stand to let them know we were leaving and this is not at all what we expected compared to what we say on the web site and we were leaving when the young rude hostess actually laughed at my wife like we were crazy!! 

We were mortified! We will never return and discourage anyone from ever going! 

We did however find a nice quiet restaurant down the street where we were greeted appropriately, treated with respect, immediately taken to a wonderful quiet table with amazing ambiance and had an amazing meal! 
 
Do yourself a favor!

This was just as bad. My young son and I stayed here for one night before heading back to WA, and other than the very sweet girl at the front desk, who was working extra since they were short staffed, was the only positive at this motel 6. I understand it is a budget motel, I didn't have grand expectations, but this was a nightmare. The room was FILTHY. Hairs and dirt all over the bathroom, blood stains underneath the top sheet, the hardwood floors were dusty and hadn't been swept, let alone disinfected. There is a GLOBAL PANDEMIC going on, and this was far below par for cleanliness, let alone during COVID. There were 2 measly bars of soap, so I left to get Lysol so that we could at least disinfect the room ourselves. What am I paying them for? The room was $60ish for the night, with a $35 deposit. How can they charge for a deposit when they don't clean the rooms? They didn't give me back my $35 deposit either, which has already been disputed by me to my bank. The power in the entire hotel went out for two hours, and the nice girl up front laughed and said 'you wish!' when other customers said 'well this should be discounted from our stay' I had blankets to wash from our previous nights stay, and the soap machine didn't work. I had to ask her and wait to get a measly cup of soap to run a load of blankets for my son and I since the beds were disgusting. We ended up sleeping in one bed, on top of our own bedding. There were homeless people in tents about 10 feet from the parking lot, which made us feel very unsafe parking there or going outside at all. My son stepped in dog or human feces in the parking lot, which I had to clean in the shower and placed to dry on one of the thin towels in our room. There was an unsettling stench throughout the hallways, and multiple guests smoking nonstop next to all the doors (my son and I are very sensitive to cigarette smoke) so much so, that my son vomited after being in this hotel for only an hour and a half. The next morning while I was showering in the dirty shower, my son said the phone rang for about 5 minutes straight. Not sure why anyone would be calling our room over and over when it's 2021, I have a cell phone and I would not touch the phone after seeing the filthiness of everything in the room. I don't normally write reviews, but during Covid I would have thought that even a budget stay motel would have some sort of cleanliness. I was very wrong. I have a feeling they aren't returning my deposit because of my sons throw up accident, but if that is the case, that is absolutely disgusting of them. The room was filthy in the first place, and I had to go spend extra money to disinfect our room. Bad form motel 6.

WARNING: 
* THIS HOTEL DOES NOT OFFER SHAMPOO OR CONDITIONER, EVEN UPON REQUEST. 

* ONE SHOWER WAS TOTALLY BROKEN.

* OWNERS JUST REPLACED THE ENTIRE STAFF WITHOUT TRAINING THE NEW ONE. FURTHERMORE, THEY HAVE NO ACCESS TO AMENITIES, NOR AUTHORITY TO ADDRESS PROBLEMS OR COMPLAINTS. (If you make the mistake of staying here, be patient with the front desk. It's the owners who are at fault here.)

* THE HEATERS SMELL LIKE THEY HAVENT BEEN USED IN YEARS.

* WE WERE CHARGED FOR 3 ROOMS INSTEAD OF 2.

[I will edit this review if/when these problems are addressed and attended to.]

This might be a contender for the worst hotel experience I've ever had.

We reserved 2 rooms via Expedia, and when we checked in (after waiting 15 minutes for a shift change), we were told (incorrectly) that only 1 room had been reserved. I had to place the second room on a credit card--and we then discovered that we *had* correctly reserved 2 rooms. As of this morning, we have been charged for *3* rooms--hopefully this will be rectified when the manager comes on shift. (So now we are forced to stick around when we wanted to already be on the road.)

Mid-shower, I discovered that no shampoo or conditioner had been provided. I went to the front desk and was told these amenities haven't been offered for a year, even on request. Neither the front desk clerk nor the manager on duty could find shampoo. (After I'd waited for over an hour, the manager graciously offered his own. I repeat, this is a problem with the owners and the hotel as a whole. The staff, all brand-new across apparently all shifts, weren't able to help, but they can hardly be blamed for ownership's many egregious failings.)

The shower in our second room was totally broken.

The heaters are loud and smell like something is burning inside.

One of the TV sets was broken off the wall and sitting on the dresser.

Nothing about this stay was satisfactory. If I were not traveling with an exhausted child, I would have walked out on principle.",2021-10-25 16:03:29 UTC,1,0,0,0,i6_hHerm2-1XF2UzgS_-_A

I spent a really exhaustive time looking up hotels for one night stay in STL. I've had some mediocre experiences lately and trust me when I say it's really important to check reviews before booking. Since you're reading this, you've gotten that memo. 

The lobby is beautiful and appears to be a really old hotel originally that has since been updated. 

Nobody was wearing masks and they are not required if you're vaccinated and/or willing to lie. 

I had a decently friendly welcome by concierge. There is an off-site parking lot just on the next block which isn't ideal but could be worse. 

The room is massive and lovely. There is a whole separate seating area and desk, one of the largest rooms I've been in recently. 

Like many other Marriotts I've been to, this place has a mart in the lobby open 24 hours with snacks and beverages. 

The TV was large and you can use your phone as a remote. They also have netflix and hbogo capabilities.

The towels were soft. The bathroom was was clean. 

The bed was soft and comfy. The thermostat works well and the room was nice and cool. 

The hotel was spank in the middle of downtown and within walking distance of the arch and many restaurants and bars. 

It was quiet af, we couldn't hear anything from any other room or the street.

I would definitely return if I was in the area and recommend staying here.",2021-07-05 05:07:37 UTC,4,3,2,4,B_dJmugCw_9OxLuH4FiUJw

First, let me say that all the staff were incredibly warm and welcoming; I had no difficulties with checking in or out and I felt like a valued guest.  That said, the rooms are not spacious and have very few amenities.  Specifically, there is a mini-fridge and a television, and that's about it.  There was free DirecTv, but programming kept being interrupted because the signal was poor.  Housekeeping won't come unless you request it, which I actually like, but it would be nice if the room was well stocked with towels.  The bathrooms have dispensers for hand soap and body wash that you have to squeeze and God only knows how many people had touched them before me.  Just not a good idea during a pandemic.  There was no closet in the room; just a small bar with hangers and 3 hooks on the wall.  The entire hotel is painted with bright colors that give you more a dorm room feel than an hotel.

We called customer service three times and it just kept hanging up. We then called reservations and I spoke to a lady named shekela. I explained to her that we prepaid for this car and our flight was delayed. All of the cars at the airport and surrounding car rental spots were sold out due to the Indy 500. We then attempted to get an $80 Uber and a Lyft and after 2.5 hours of waiting we were not able to get one. We were there for a wedding and had to call the groom to come get us from the airport. I emailed the cancellation people and they told me it would be $234.00 to cancel even though their policy says $100 cancellation fee. I really don't see how the flight being delayed was our fault. They showed no compassion or anything. I will never ever recommend anyone to rent from them nor will I. This was the worst experience I have ever had with a rental car.

I will never rent a vehicle with Sixt ever!!! I had car trouble on my way to Atlanta, in one of their vehicles. The vehicle was shaking, so we were driving at low speeds because we did not feel safe. I call Sixt Indianapolis Airport where l had rented the car and Rochelle said she could not help me and l needed to call customer service. Customer service said that was fine l could go and exchange a vehicle at another Sixt once l got to Atlanta. Easy right, NO, Sixt Indianapolis then called me threatening to charge me a drop off fee of $900 if l did not return the car to Indianapolis. I told them the customer service they had told me to call was glad to change the vehicle and ensure our safety. Sheila/Alice/Stella whatever her name was then told me that Sixt is franchised meaning they operate as individual companies versus a national company. Therefore that car was owned by the Indianapolis Airport Sixt and needed to return there because they would have to find someone to go to Atlanta to pick it up. I asked her why then l was told to call customer service and that so l was required to drive an unsafe car back to Indy, she said yes. She added her boss had drove the car before and it was fine, okay? So what does that have to do with our current problem? IF SIXT IS NOT ONE COMPANY AND THEY ARE ALL DIFFERENT FRANCHISES THEN WHY NOT HAVE DIFFERENT NAMES. This was my first time renting with Sixt and DEFINATELY!!! THE LAST. They taught me a hard lesson JUST STICK TO REPUTABLE car rental places like Budget, Avis, National, Hertz, Enterprise that have been in business forever, they have realized that customer service is important to grow a business a concept Sixt has obviously not mastered. I guess that explains why when l picked up the car, Sixt counter was empty with one or two people yet they were long lines by Avis and Budget.

I took a Lyft from an eyeglass place to a Wal-Mart, at around 1:30pm EST on Monday, May 10th. The driver, Mayra, was cordial, though neither of us spoke much.
I made the mistake of leaving my only phone in her car.
A Wal-Mart employee let me use her phone to try to contact Lyft. The conveniently had no number for me to call, to speak to a person.
I wound up using that person's phone to book another Lyft to get home.
After I got home, at about 5p, I got a reply from a Lyft employee named Elena, letting me know that she had forwarded my email and street addresses to Mayra, with a request for contact.
The next day, around noon, I sent another email to inquire about my phone, as I still Hadn't heard back from them.
Elena responded that she'd reach out to Mayra again.
I replied that the drive could at least let me know if she had my phone, as I needed it for work, & it had all my info in it.
I had to get a new phone, to log into work, on the same day; emailed such by 3:18pm EST, stating that I still wanted the old one back, and that they could call me now, if necessary.
The response, by around 5:47p EST, was that they were unable to reach the driver, and that ""It's important to note that drivers are independent contractors and are not required to keep in direct contact with us"", and the email also contained some link that didn't work.
I responded, letting them know that this was unacceptable, and that I wanted a supervisor, if the driver were still allowed to make money working for them after such behavior. I also mentioned legal action.
I received my last response, from a Melisa, at about 6:44, which was a de facto shrug, stating that the driver had been unresponsive, and that they were unable to take any further action, but would let me know if they heard anything.
My final email to them mentioned that that reply hadn't fully answered my question, and that, if I didn't receive a meaningful reply, I'd be posting about all of this, names included, so everyone would know about their service.
It has been radio silence ever since. As far as I know this child I still employee by Lyft, making money; not even bothering to respond to situations such as this one.

The reply was the same form-letterese shrug and to review the terms of service, without commenting on whether the driver will by under you employ or not. I replied that I'd update my reviews accordingly!",2021-05-15 00:50:35 UTC,1,0,0,0,keKYj8jwHVKjWQqSN0GI2Q

I called the day before my check in date to make sure everything was good to go. When I called the lady who addressed the phone was clearly talking to a coworker or someone else. I had to say hello 3 times before she addressed me on the phone. I called asking basic questions, making sure my reservations was good, that it was okay that I had a dog, and what time I could check in, like if I could check in earlier than 3. She made me feel like I was bothering her calling and asking these questions m, she was super short and answered with an attitude. The next day I get there 30 mins early at 2:30 I go to the front desk to see if maybe I can check in early. She advise me that I was not able to check in yet. I was fine waiting the 30 mins as I was early on my part anyways. I requested that I have a ground floor room as I had my dog with me and my grandma and it would help us a lot. I go back to my car and let my dog out after driving 3 hours. While letting my dog out I observed a couple get out of their car with their suitcases and go into a room on the ground floor clearly just getting there and was able to check in before 3 where I was told I had to wait. At 2:55 I go back to the front desk to check in. Again feeling like I'm bothering the lady at the front desk as she sighed out aloud when I asked her if I could check in now. She let me check in but told me there was no rooms on the ground floor and I'd have to take the 2nd floor and didn't know when a room on the ground floor would be ready. At this point I just took it as my grandma and dog have been in the car on a drive for 3 hours already and then we just waited 30 mins in the parking lot to check in. I needed to get them out of the car and settled into the room. I take the keys for room 218 and go get my grandma and dog to go to the room. As doing this I again observed a set of two couples sharing a hotel room check in and get a ground floor room. A little irritated as I was just told there were no rooms on the ground floor ready I go up to room 218. As I open the door the room was not ready at all. The beds weren't made. Sheets and bedding were on the floor and the smelled. I quickly closed the room and took my dog and grandma back to the car. I as I'm heading back to the front desk I notice 108, a room on the ground floor was ready, the window was open, beds were made and no one was in it. I go back to the front desk and let her know what happen and that I would request 108 since it seems ready. She gives me attitude and tells me she will have to go look for herself. She goes and comes back and gives me the keys to room 108. I was super disappointed and if it wasn't so late in the day I would have gone and looked for a different hotel. I never once got a sorry, or anything. Just an attitude and made me feel like I was bothering them. Over all the room was alright. The pillows sucked and our tub had some water left in it from the plug being down and we had to go ask for toilet paper as the one in our room was pretty much gone and they didn't replace it or have another roll in the room, the fixtures in the room such as lamps where rusted but those are just little things. I would have probably stayed again in the future but after how I was treated I wouldn't. I don't recommend this place.

We booked 1.5 hr  private charter for 2. The weather on the day of our scheduled trip was windy, and I called ahead of time to ask it it would have been a concern. The owner said that the captain ok'ed the trip. When we arrived we were pleasantly surprised that Captain Charlie installed clear shields to protect us from the wind. It was so thoughtful! We still could enjoy the views, go to the open part of the boat, and then come inside if it was too windy - and still see everything. Charlie was great and told us a lot of interesting stories and facts about Santa Barbara. He is also a very experienced captain and the ride was really smooth and enjoyable. I highly recommend Celebration Cruises private charter for an enjoyable  afternoon or sunset tour with great views. Great price, too, and you can bring your own food and wine.",2021-04-01 00:36:21 UTC,5,0,0,0,QMg3BGjId94RvoMfa5e0fQ

Jake enhanced our enjoyment with his friendly yet professional & prompt drink service and his insightful commentaries to our discussions and shared experience.

Two hours before we were supposed to depart, they decided to have the Azure Seas depart from the Harbor instead of Sterns Wharf because the swells at the wharf. They were very proactive in informing us leaving an e-mail, voicemail, AND a text informing of the new harbor location and address. 

They had COVID restrictions in place and were enforced. Usual capacity was 46, but was lowered to 25 due to the pandemic. The cruise was sold out at 25 people, but I felt comfortable with the amount of people on the boat.  Masks were mandatory at all times except when eating or drinking. A great and safe way to get out of the house. 

As promised, we saw a whale and they gladly answered all our questions we had about him. Great view of the ocean while sipping their signature Azure Seas cocktail. Would recommend this trip to anyone.",2021-03-02 22:15:59 UTC,5,0,0,0,NxymwS-MXIHCNnBb4iNLmQ

I do not recommend paying for the ""first class"" tickets, however. There is a small section on the top deck with nice chairs, but that was full as we were the end of first class boarding; so the other option for first class seats was a bench in front of the captains window. Yes it was still upstairs, but the bench was the same as seating for the lower deck.
The ""first class"" ticket also advertises priority drink service, but we were served only moments before the other passengers.
So if you really want to be on the top deck, then pay the extra, otherwise the cruise is enjoyable with the regular price.",2021-07-27 20:32:36 UTC,4,0,0,0,i1pDSEwt5xBy_5kEiQFrBA

Alexis and owner Cathy were both really great to work with.  We also got to bring our own food and set it up on board.  It was a lovely, lovely afternoon and their staff was terrific.  I was a little worried as the wind kicked up but it died down after we were on board a bit and the sun came out - yeah. 

This was not the first time I had been on the Azure Seas.   I had been on their public tours before (happy hour tour for my husband's birthday and sunset tour with my cousin).  I recommend both.  However, this was the first time I booked a private event and they did a good job.  It is a unique and wonderful group experience.  We even had plenty of parking right near the boarding ramp for all of us; we deliberately booked a weekday in September with that in mind.

I have also booked their small electric boat, Whisper, a couple of times pre-Covid for a birthday cruise with friends and we were able to bring our own champagne and munchies.  Even though the Whisper does not go out as far along the coast, we learned a lot from the knowledgeable captain, enjoyed seeing some of the other boats close up, played good music and had a great time with a small group of friends.

I highly recommend this company.

What a great idea and fun thing to do in Santa Barbara ! My girlfriend and I decided to do their Whale watching tour ! Due to Covid they only had I think about 25 people on board but there was still plenty of room to walk around and sit and didn't feel crowded by any means. I believe it was Captain Matt and Jake and another girl I forgot her name but they were our crew !

They were so great ! The captain was funny and very informative when it come to telling about what to expect and what we might see ! It is a beautiful yacht and we purchased the tickets so we could go to the upper level but I even went down to the lower deck to hang out and you can sit inside or outside . They have drink and snacks available ! 

I don't drink anymore but I must say some of the drinks I saw people get looked pretty good and they order more than one so they must of been good. About an hour into the cruise the captain came over the intercom and said he spotted some whales about 300 yards ahead and sure enough I looked out that way and say a couple spouts !! So cool ! 

We got closer and the captain started describing which whales he thought they were , Gray Whales and we even saw some dolphins following them. We got close but not to close I dunno if it was because of safety for the whales or what but we could still see plenty , but just wish I would of brought binoculars. definitely would of helped . But all in all it was an amazing experience and a beautiful time out at sea. I strongly recommend everyone to try this.

On the day of the cruise captain Mike had a lot of interesting information to share with us about Santa Barbara and the marine life we spotted while we were out on the water. We even got to see dolphins which was icing on the cake. It was a very special day and I can't thank you all enough. I highly recommend coming out with them on any of their boats.,2021-11-21 21:06:47 UTC,5,0,0,0,JaZHn2rSEERp2XDekX0HUA

Paid in advance.  When we arrived at the appointed time the boat was there but were told we'd be unable to board it at that location due to rough water, which didn't appear to be the case.  We were told to walk about 20 minutes to another location.  While on our walk, they called and the story changed.  Not enough people had signed up so our cruise was cancelled.  I was told to call another number to request a refund.  I refused.  After some back and forth they called me back and said they would initiate the refund and offered us another cruise free of charge which was of no value to us as we were leaving the next morning.  The fact that they solicited a tip for the crew before even providing the service should have been a clue.  I've run a small business for years and sometimes have to make good on promises or sales that are not profitable.

However they refuse to wait the extra 5 mins for their passengers even tho there are no other boats waiting for the slip.
3) No refunds
4) No transfers. 
Why would a business not do the right then and just say oh you couldn't find parking? no problem that literally happens every single day, people who gave us over $200...we will get you on the next boat and if that's full / you don't have time then here's a credit come back anytime we want to give you what you paid us for.

I also was Hilton elite for many years. As a medical consultant I have stayed at over 300 hotels.  This was the second worst stay. The worst stay was at a hampton inn in miami where someone defecated on the carpet and opening the door the smell was unbearable.  Here the room was extremely dirty with left over pills on the floor ect. I tolerated it though. Even though I had a noon checkout at approximately 11:30 housekeeping knocked on my door while I was on the toilet.  I am a a cancer patient on chemotherapy so I yelled very loud,  ""late checkout."" I probably kept on yelling for 30 seconds but the male housekeeper kept on knocking.  When I was finally able to open the door he said to my face ""Now you don't have to be all ignorant"".  There was a female housekeeper as well and said ""you see what I have to put up with."" Of course this being the housekeepers and the hotel being filthy and unkempt I then said this is the dirtiest hotel I ever stayed in and closed the door shut. Ten minutes later the front desk called me and her exact words were ""why are you calling my housekeepers shi##y. You need to leave now."" I told her patiently I will leave when I am ready to leave having almost all my things packed and I called the room dirty not your housekeepers.  5 minutes later I was still very angry as this was the first time someone wanted to kick me out of their hotel.  Normally I feel like family every time I check in to a Hyatt or Marriott .  I then called downstairs and said I am elite of almost every hotel chain and this was one of my worst stays which ended with your housekeeper calling me ignorant. As I left I saw the housekeepers leaning on the balcony. I told them I took pictures of the room and will write a review on tripadvisor. The female housekeeper said ""we clean the room well and if we find anything in the room it is yours....so if we find a bowl it is yours"".  That bothered me because now she was trying to frame me for drugs.  I did not respond.  Today I realized I left my drivers license in the hotel room. I just called the front desk and they said it was not there.  The last place I remember seeing it was my night stand in room 228.  I do not think I will see it again because your housekeepers probably stole it and then destroyed it. Also when I left my room I found crack pipes on the grass.


The next time I am going to stay at the Hyatt House in Mt Laurel again where I stayed the weekend before. The manager e-mailed me to thank me for my stay. This is what he said, 
""Dear Christopher :

Please know that your feedback is extremely valuable to us and we will utilize your response to make every guest experience the best it can be. I greatly appreciate your kind words and they will be celebrated with the entire team.

My track record with booking hotels is not the best. And when I mean not the best, I mean absolutely awful. So I was shocked when my husband said it was up to me to book our hotel for Nashville. Okay babe, careful what you wish for...

To both our surprises, I booked a pretty good spot! After looking at hotels online for hours, I settled on Hyatt House Nashville at Vanderbilt. This hotel is near the university which is pretty nice. I mean, we don't have buildings like this in Vegas. The are surrounding isn't too bad. We even walked a couple days to go grab food nearby (Hattie B's is within walking distance). 

Checking in was really easy. The hotel is clean and nice and I want to say about 20 minutes from the airport and a 10 minute Lyft ride to Broadway, which is really why we selected it. The staff here was so welcoming. Our room was really nice and clean. I wish I had pictures of it before but since we had an early flight we were happy to check in to our room and just relax for a bit. Because of Covid, we didn't have anyone cleaning our rooms throughout but any time we called for more towels or something it was never an issue. They also have a little conscience store in the lobby where you can purchase snacks and whatnot. 

Our stay was really pleasant and nice. Every time we had a run in with staff, they were soooo friendly. One girl kept telling me she loooved my outfit and I just thought that was so sweet. That southern charm! 

On our last day our flight was much later but we had to check out of the hotel. We asked if we could leave our luggage for the day and they held it for us without charge which I thought was really nice. 

I would definitely recommend this hotel in Nashville. Beautiful and clean room and the staff is outstanding!",2021-08-05 15:48:34 UTC,5,30,16,34,l1b__qNXrWmttE_mMampbA

It took an entire hour to check in, because the staff are new/untrained (turn over must be ridiculous), and they were, rightfully, being bombarded with customer complaints. Some of the rooms are flooded, some of them aren't properly prepared, and some still have people in them who should be checked out - all information gathered by listening to the complaints of the lobby which was packed full of angry guests. 

After I checked in, my family and I made our way up to our room, but not before being greeted by a literal cloud of fruit flys, the smell of burnt hair, and cigarette smoke. At this point, my hopes for our room were, essentially, non-existent; but we were surprised upon entering and not in a good way! The carpets were covered in stains - they're literally everywhere (pictures are some of the bigger stains). The walls were covered in smoke, nicotine, and general grime. The bedding was covered in urine stains and smelt... off putting. The climate control unit was covered in grime and what might be black mold (see pictures) - and yeah, this place is just freaking gross. Like, gross to the point where I am beyond confused how this place is open; but then again, I guess I got a room here and stayed! If I wasn't exhausted from a 15 hour drive it would have been a different story though. But even then, when I was in the lobby I heard a customer complaining about getting charged 3 times who was then told to basically go kick rocks. So, I doubt I would have got my money back in a timely manner, if at all anyways.

Now, I understand there's a lot of my complaints are anecdotal, but please look to the pictures I've provided as proof and just save your money. Sleep in your car if you can. Spend that money on a nice travel pillow. In fact, spend it anywhere other than this dump - please, for your health and sanity.

So, I rambled and joked a bit, but in all seriousness, this place needs to be closed this very second and all guests should have their money refunded.

Hotels.com and any other businesses that allow bookings for this location need to IMMEDIATELY discontinue the ability to do so until the owner of this location is held accountable and changes are made.

Edit: I forgot to add that there was a used needle outside my window. If Yelp will show the rest of the pictures I've posted, it's in there for viewing.",2021-10-28 23:19:59 UTC,1,0,0,0,WhB2aFeGNHFRSNH9QodGvA

Keep looking for a hotel ! I wish I checked yelp before I made my reservation !On Saturday 9/18/21. I arrived at La Quinta Inn in Indianapolis East-Post Drive around 10 pm.

No one was there. The security guard comes to the desk. I explained I paid and had a confirmation. He took my confirmation page and made a copy. I ask for the manager. He said that she was on the phone. I said I wanted to talk to her. I waited a few minutes and finally a young girl comes to the counter. In the mean time 4 other parties came in and were told that their reservations were cancelled also. She said she wasn't the manager and that their computer was down. That the manager told her to cancel all the reservation. I asked her how she was going to correct this situation ? She said this was ""NOT HER PROBLEM "" !! I said I wanted my money back. She said I paid Wyndham not her. She said to call 1800-642-4241 and handed me a cancellation letter. I drove additional 125 miles stopped in at hotels and called many.

You can tell welfare sends people here when the shelters are full or people have been evicted. The atmosphere of the property is less motel and more homeless shelter or inner city government housing complex, and I promise I am not trying to be ignorant by saying that. Doors propped open with loud hip hop music blaring, people shouting at each other across the buildings, cigarette butts everywhere etc. The first red flag should have been that as we pulled up, there was police activity in the parking lot. I walked into the office area and an employee came running in extremely annoyed and rolling her eyes the whole time like I was bothering her. The stairwell smelled like urine. The room smelled like rotting fish and there were flies all over the room, stains on the carpets/sheets/towels and an unidentified sticky substance all over the desk and nightstands like it had not been cleaned in months. I am not one to ever complain about little things or exaggerate but I genuinely felt sick to my stomach in that room. Oh and the nightstands were designed with outlets built right in which I thought was cool. Well of course it didn't work so I turned it around to see if it was plugged in to the wall and the entire electrical wire was either cut or burned off.  Leaving the next morning, I witnessed a man get out of his car and walk into a room with a prostitute (again, not being ignorant, the young woman was not trying to be subtle about the situation at all). This is all a shame because Red Roof is a chain and I have never had anything less than pleasant experiences at any of their other locations.

Our room was nice but needed some minor maintenance--the blackout shade was broken and wouldn't lower, and the sliding door to the bathroom was difficult to move.

La Quintas are usually great options for travelers but this one is an exception. My first room had a stopped up toilet, the bathroom light was burnt out and there was dirt and goopy yellow stuff all over the sinks. I got switched to a new room that was slightly better but the swing nut was ripped out of the wall so there was no way to lock it other than the deadbolt, which was more concerning when I had found out there was a shooting at the Steak n Shake right next door 2 nights before my stay. Bed was pretty comfortable although there was a good amount of road noise coming through the windows. Finally--despite the hotel promising a free breakfast with the reservation, apparently they have not gotten approval to serve breakfast so none was available, nor was hot coffee. 

Easily the worst La Quinta I have ever stayed in. Unclean, no amenities available, and in what appeared to be a very unsafe area with unsavory people hanging out in the parking lot late at night (confined by the steak and shake employee who was stationed outside the restaurant telling people not to come in because of the shooting).

Also, being just a $7 Uber to just about anywhere you need to be, along with plenty of walkable places to eat (including the world famous, Hattie B's) makes the location convenient.

Pros
Sever had a pleasant personality 
Turkey Bacon Melt was good

Cons
Dirty dishes remained on our table the whole time
Server never checked as we were eating our meal to see if the food was okay
Server never offered drink refills
I had to ask the manager where the soup and rolls were as we were sitting there forever and they were never brought out
The cashier was eating food at the cash register and did not ask how the meal was
We waited for our check a while. We pushed all the dishes to the side of the table to indicate we were done and put our masks on and just sat there waiting.


There was barely anyone in the restaurant eating!! If it was busy I would totally understand not checking on us, not offering drink refills, not pre-busting but it was not busy!!

The check in process was fast and easy. We were on the fourth floor overlooking the pool.  Our room was spacious with very good lighting. Our bathroom was very nice and the soap and the products they use felt and smelled good. The only thing I thought was needed was more hooks for your towels, but that is problem in every hotel.  The shower hot water came down perfect flw and the water got hot right away.  We are here for two nights while my husband plays pool in a state tournament. I have been very busy spending all our money in the casino.  One gift shop closes at 5pm.  I thought it needed to stay open much later for guests that arrive late. It also could have used books or magazine to read and relax.  Overall, I really think this is a very nice comfortable hotel.  Here is the question I always ask myself.  Would I come back?

We were very happy with our room!

The pool was great on the Estrella side, nice big water slide and plenty of room to sit and enjoy some sunshine and fresh air.  There is also an arcade (with newer interactive games) plus a gym.  Everything seemed clean and updated.

Staff was very friendly, from phone calls and check-in all the way through check-out.  We needed extra towels and tissue and they arrived within 5 minutes.  Great service.

Comfy beds, complimentary waters.  Ice machine is on floor 2 and 4 (figures since we were on the 3rd floor).  

We took several walks around the grounds and enjoyed the landscaping and the beauty of the casino as well.  The amphitheater is awesome!  Great sound, easy to get to and decent prices.  Check the schedule before you book, you may be in for a great treat!  Rooms ran us about $200/night.

About a 20-30 minute drive to downtown Tucson, we Ubered since we weren't sure how parking would be on the weekends.

Lots of great places to eat in the casino too!  Breakfast at Moby's, sushi at Ume, delicious gelato counter at Sweetscape, and the cookies and brownies at the Streetscape pizza place are AMAZING!!!

Our only real complaint was that upon check-in there was a used brown bag in our trash and a half eaten pickle.  Wouldn't have been so gross but there was pickle juice and smell during our whole visit.  And while on the subject, we arrived on a Friday and in the trash can next to the elevator was a pizza box, it stayed there and was still there when we checked out on Sunday.  There was also a clothing size sticker on the hallway floor for our entire stay as well.  Not big things, but enough to notice.  (we finally unstuck the sticker and tossed it in with the pizza box on our way out though)

I would not hesitate at all to stay at Estrella again!

The inconvenience of walking through the casino several tomes to finalize our checkout was very disturbing. The fact that every member of our party needed to be present at the check in desk to get our room keys was stupid. Obviously we can't leave our packed car unattended outside the doors and there were no valets by the hotel entrance doors!!!! If just one of the security guards stood by the door a d confirmed that people entering were masked and allowed limited number of people through the hotel entrance doors that would have made all the difference! Allowing the bellman unlimited access with our luggage through this doorway and forcing customers to leave the side of their belongings to tramp through the Casino entrance, through the casino to get to the front desk and room elevators is STUPID and caused concern! Where are my bags going without me??? Does the bellman have the room number? What was his name if I have to track him down? Why is the Security Guard so very, very, very, very rude? When my daughter stepped one foot in the doorway to tell her father he needed to leave the car unattended and walk around the building to the casino entrance with the baby in order for us to complete our check in the guard was very rude to her and forced her to completely exit the building forcing her to have to walk around to the casino entrance, through the casino to the hotel check in desk. Our party got completely separated and confused and frustrated by this dragonian, unrealistic policy. It gave us a bad first impression and started our holiday off on an unpleasant note. Someone from management needs to evaluate this process and fix it. 1) station valets outside those hotel entrance doors so they can explain the policy, 2) instruct security to use common sen e and to test your customers with respect, 3) more and better signage by hotel and casino entrance doors explaining hotel checkin policies.

I would give this casino one star except nobody would see this review. I have been to this casino 10 times. Three of those times included negative experiences. The first being at one of their dining facilities and they're oddly depressing poker room. The second being having my husband repeatedly harassed by security to put on his mask while he was smoking or drinking, during the same night we saw casino security rip drinks from people's hands and throw them out of the casino that had been causing no problems or issues with anybody. Casino security seem to be standing around almost looking for issues to cause and they made the atmosphere extremely uncomfortable. The same weekend we won $10,000 we were never asked by security if we'd like an escort to our vehicle but they had time to harass guest and throw them off of the property who had been causing no problem It was utterly bizarre but we figured maybe they had seen something we hadn't so we gave them the benefit of the doubt.  We gave the casino multiple chances after just these incidents. We came out on free hotel nights planning to stay the weekend of May 8th 2021. It is this weekend that was the deciding factor in writing this review and the final nail in the coffin on why we will never return. We had been having a lovely evening we had met four other people who we were having fun with playing slots. We ended up in the high limit area where we continue to play together on the same machine. While three of our group went to buy another round of drinks they were sold the drinks and promptly had security called on them. Security informed them that they were being cut off they could not have the drinks and they had to go back to their hotel rooms and we're not allowed to come out of the hotel rooms again. I and one of the other women had not been at the bar during this event and were also included in the go to your room policy. When asked for clarification on what we had done wrong all they would tell us was that was the policy that when you are cut off you're only option is to go to your room and to stay there. I have never heard of a place selling you drinks and cutting you off after giving you the drinks they had just sold you normally if you cut someone off it's prior to serving them more alcohol not after so you get the money in the tip. I asked for them to assist us and leaving the casino in its entirety at that point as I was not comfortable being detained in my room when nobody had done anything wrong or illegal. I was promptly informed by security that it wasn't their problem and they would not assist us in leaving the property despite the fact we had been drinking our only option was to go to our room and stay there. I informed security that I will not be detained and if they would like us to leave we would happily leave but since we had been drinking we couldn't drive our vehicle and we would need a cab called for us and our vehicle towed and they would not assist. They instead decided to call the police on us. I inform the police, security was attempting to detain us in our room and we still weren't really sure why we were being kicked out especially since we had paid for the drinks that they had now confiscated why did they serve us drinks if there was an issue? The police could not get clear answers out of casino security either and we're also getting frustrated with casino security. The police had to inform casino security they could not detain us in our room and that we were allowed outside to smoke or to get food or beverages. The police had to inform casino security not to call about our group again for the remainder of the evening. The police also reiterated to casino security that we were in fact allowed to leave our rooms to smoke and that they needed to leave us alone to do that. I went out two times to smoke and both times the same security followed me around and would stand and stare at me while I was smoking in an attempt to intimidate me. This all unfolded at about 3:00 in the morning by 6:00am our bags were packed and we were leaving the casino hotel. If we were so intoxicated how was it we were able to drive at 6:00 a.m.? During checkout we had hotel staff contact security so that we could file official complaint for the previous night. Hotel staff even said that many people have had issues with casino security and that there seems to be an issue with security being overly aggressive. Hotel staff even said they have issues with security and not being able to get a hold of them. we waited for 30 minutes while hotel staff attempted to contact security to have someone come over. Casino security sent the slot machine manager over instead. The slot machine manager also confirmed that there is serious issues with the security and we're absolutely not surprised to hear about the issue we had had near hours earlier.  This issue occurred on the 8th.  They have lied about a refund for the fraud committed by bar staff.",2021-06-17 17:49:09 UTC,3,0,0,4,G0wR_oOLeMT7QxsRyYNrww

Casino Del Sol was having a Bead/jewelry show. It was somewhat of a drive but a nice day out.
We had a handicap sticker and were able to use one of the parking places close to the hotel.
This was the first bead show in almost 2 years.  We were hungry to see vendors.  The ballroom was almost filled with vendors selling various things. It was fun to see all the things for sale. We didn't buy much but still enjoyed our day out.  
I was somewhat surprised that not everybody was masked. The hotel/casino required masks for those who are unvaccinated. People that were vaccinated did not have to wear a mask. This rule held true in the casino as well.

We spent 4 days being told what we must or could not do. Standing at the bar with your party required masks between sips but sitting down 6 ft away required no mask. Security guards were rude, nobody was accommodating. It was just ridiculous. People are trying to have fun and give you business and the attitude was basically they would prefer you didn't exist.

This is a ""historical art lodging experience"".  This is not just a place to sleep and shower... You can experience your entire stay in the hotel and surrounding district that it anchors, the Bottleworks.

First of all, the rooms, the hallways, every single detail is a work of art and somehow it's both beautiful and functional. The rooms are expansive, functional, comfortable and beautiful. They perfectly marry preservation of old architectural elements like golden railings, green subway tile and iconic spiral staircase with modern seating in the wide hallways that could double as lounge areas. You experience the modern creativity and step back into history as you walk to your room. Some rooms can be a bit of a walk but I didn't mind because of the intriguing art and atmosphere that made the journey an experience.

In the room, the two head shower including overhead shower is amazing. The staff was always friendly and helpful. The mini bar included several local selections, and where there is obviously a margin included in pricing, you won't be doubling your room stay $$ by getting a bottle of wine or water...that's a nice convenience! There was plenty of glassware to support in room partaking. The convenience items in the bathroom were perfect as we had forgotten to pack a few things: decent shampoo conditioner and body wash, bar soap for hands and face, and we needed a qtip which was in the additional kit! Bonus!

Other things with easy access in the building - Great cocktails in the club room bar. Fantastic local selections for breakfast and lunch as well as vice at Blue Collar Coffee. Amazing modern interpretation of traditional Asian cuisine at Modita. Nails at W nail bar and relaxing serices at Woodhouse spa.... All these things without leaving the building! Super perfect on our selected weekend which turned out to be a little rainy. If you want to cross the street amazing food selection at the garage, play a little with friends at Pins, catch a movie at the theater or some yoga at Yoga 6.

$45 valet if you want in and out privileges, $12 garage or outdoor lot parking on the west side of Carrollton. You can also use Parkmobile for street parking but that is hard to manage for an overnight stay. In the room night stand was too small for my preference...I find this true at many hotels... Lighting options were great. Could make the room very dark even though our windows looked into and outdoor white tile courtyard. Many meeting rooms and event spaces would make gorgeous venues for a variety of occasions. I didn't ask but didn't see that they have a gift shop/convenience store yet, so you might have to order delivery or walk down Mass Ave to get essentials you might have forgotten to pack. Hanging bar in closet was a little low for this maxi dress wearing tall girl.

All in all....I will stay here again even as a local because it's about the experience and they do it right. The price point is higher than other hotels in the area a little but it is worth a little extra to stay here and actually want it to be your temporary home base.",2021-05-17 22:59:39 UTC,5,1,0,2,_-u8BDbETSZwFmUYJob_cQ
PNRi6tvJN989IuGqpydE4A,Bon-Aire Resort,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel",St. Pete Beach,27.7183642,-82.7396347,4.5,47,NV,"Don't judge a hotel by it's outside sign and front lobby area is what I learned on this trip. If I was driving on Gulf Blvd to find a hotel, I would have kept on driving past as this isn't the type of hotel I usually stay at. 

To say I was pleasantly surprised is a huge understatement. 

One of my friends recommended the Bon Aire as she and her husband have stayed numerous times and have enjoyed it. She kept telling me, ""it's not fancy, so don't expect a lot."" I agree, it isn't fancy, but it's just what I was looking for; a clean, comfortable place to stay for a quick weekend get-a-way with one of my girlfriends. We stayed for three nights - we were informed that we'd have to change rooms after the first night but would be able to leave our luggage with them. My ONLY complaint is not having a secure place to store our luggage. We were told to ""just leave it in the lobby"" unfortunately leaving a suitcase full of my personal belongings next to a map rack on the other side (where customers walk) near the exit door is not my idea of a safe holding place for luggage. People are walking in and out of the lobby all day. We weren't the only guests changing rooms that day (other suitcases sitting out) - so either they need to do a better job of booking rooms so this doesn't happen as frequently or have a locked area to put luggage. Even putting luggage in the back office or behind the front desk would have been a reasonable accommodation. It's something that I would expect from a hotel if they are asking guests to do this as the majority of us are flying in and don't have a car to put them in when we're waiting for our new room. 

The majority of the staff was awesome!! Had a couple issues with one employee at the front desk who I'll call  ""J"" who was not at all friendly, very short, and on the rude side. However the rest of the staff at the front desk, housekeeping, and bartenders at Sandbar Bills were great! The staff especially at Sandbar Bill's were super friendly and the drinks were great as was the food and reasonably priced, which is something that doesn't always happen, especially in a touristy area. 

I loved how the hotel was literally steps away from the beach. This is my first time to St. Pete Beach but not Florida. I'm used to having to walk a long way to get to the sand, not here - it's amazing! Our second room was on the second floor which I would request again as many of the early risers were grouping up for their morning coffee (5:30am) right outside our first floor bedroom window and it got a bit noisy. This hotel is also within walking distance to Walgreens and Publix as well as cute and delicious restaurants and morning lattes  

All in all, I had a great time!! I highly recommend the Bon Aire. If you're looking for a beachy resort, and have no agenda, and want to stay in a family owned resort that takes you back in time, this is the place for you. 

I would have given it five stars if it wasn't for the lack of secure luggage storage.",2021-04-28 00:15:52 UTC,4,0,0,1,dz-4MNSiiklZsCQyyqGPMQ

It will keep the whole family entertained for an evening. I've done it twice now and can't recommend enough.

You'll definitely want to wear a bathingsuit as you'll have time to get off on an island and you have to wade through the water to get into the boat, but bring something to throw on over it for the great sunset photos you'll inevitably want to take.

The boat is always very accommodating in making sure no one gets left behind to start the tour. On the way out, you'll get some details about the Gulf and the different areas around St. Pete. Cash bar as you make your way out to the island. There are always dolphins and they usually get quite close to the boat. Once on the island, you have about an hour to explore. Last time we did the tour, my fiance and I gathered close to 30 sand dollars in pristine condition, which was a pretty cool experience.

On the way back to shore, you get an hour of open bar and can really get your money's worth if you choose to. The boat stays out on the water for sunset and gives everyone an opportunity to get their photo before returning you to shore.

They have my money and we are standing at hotel.   Kind of a we got you attitude!   The only reason I received a credit for a portion of the room is that they knew I had loyalty status with another hotel less than a few blocks away and I had a guarantee to get a room.

Hotel is so beautiful, the Art Deco is stunning outside and in. Staff is so friendly and personable. On our first stay the on-demand TV function wasn't working, I texted the front desk (they text you before you arrive) and they sent a maintenance person up almost immediately (was 8pm on Saturday night). Was a simple issue and was fixed quickly. Everything was so clean on our first stay. The only thing noted on the second stay was some staining on the ottomans at the food of the bed, but everything else is immaculate. Love the location and there is so much happening on Mass Ave, that there's hardly any reason to go any further.

The area is great with tons to do in short walking distance. The Garage food hall is just across the street and definitely worth a visit. 

Overall Bottleworks is a very unique property and I'm so glad to have them here in Indy. It's easily the best local stay we've ever had.

We had a lovely stay, and can't wait to stay again some day. The hotel was pristine and had such a cool vibe. Our room was so spacious, and had a great sitting area! We enjoyed drinks on the cozy couch and loved the large windows that let in such great natural light. Speaking of the windows.. those blinds were awesome and were perfect for allowing us to sleep in! The bed was super comfy and we loved the robes that were in the room. Also, we didn't think prices were bad at all for drinks in the room. We loved the dry red wine!

She legit did this about 10 times in an hour when check out wasn't even until noon.

They have a contental breakfast until 9:30 but I was saddened by what was left at 9am.  Basically just juice, milk, Frosted Flakes or plain Cherrios, english muffins and a singular bagel. We decided to go out to breakfast instead, which is honestly not a big deal.  I don't want to be too hard on a hotel for not having a great breakfast spread when the covid pandemic hasn't ended.

The big positive is that I usually can't sleep first night traveling because of anxiety, but I actually slept!  I don't know if the A/C being loud reminded me of home or if the pillows were that comfy, but I got some solid sleep for once at a hotel.  Overall, if you need somewhere to sleep this isn't a bad place.  Just don't expect an amazing breakfast and put a ""don't disturb"" sign up if you like to left undisturbed.",2021-05-30 15:34:35 UTC,3,21,8,25,OzXTpKIjrKy28sFVXiGOdA

This hotel is the crowning glory of the Bottleworks District, and stepping into Bottleworks Hotel feels like stepping onto the set of a Wes Anderson film: Everything is arranged just so, but unpretentiously. The hotel occupies the top two floors of the historic Coca-Cola Bottling Plant, and fortunately, it retains many of the original features.

Entering the lobby, I couldn't help but marvel over the beauty of the hotel: the art deco-style doors and terrazzo floors, the gold details and colorful ceramic tiles. My children were less impressed with the historic architecture and more impressed with the pool table located in the lobby, but hey -- to each his own!

Our room -- the Landmark Queen, which included two queen beds -- was located in the original wing of the hotel. Among other charming details, it featured a walk-in rain shower and soft, luxurious robes to wear during our stay.

As we walked around the hotel, we discovered an old-fashioned photo booth, and a wall lined with dozens of old cameras. Each session in the photo booth costs $5, and you get both a color and black-and-white series of photos. If you'd rather not plunk down a fiver, you could always take a selfie for free by the huge wall of old cameras. It's definitely 'gram-worthy.

Some of the details that make Bottleworks Hotel unique: Each hotel door is a shiny, bright, Coca-Cola red. A grand, winding staircase at the back of the hotel features an ornate ceiling design that harkens back to its 1930s past. There are art books and couches on each floor, which invite you to stay a while and read. Lined all along the walls are black-and-white photos of people, from construction workers to rock stars. It's all these details that add up to a one-of-a-kind hotel experience.

On the first floor is the Club Room, the bar and lounge that's set up with tables and couches. I would highly suggest getting the Oceanview cocktail, made with white rum, blackberry, coconut cream, pineapple and lime. It's a tropical, milky pink concoction that I'm still thinking about. The bartender said that it's pretty popular, so jump on that bandwagon.

We loved our stay at Bottleworks Hotel, and I genuinely can't wait to stay again.",2021-01-23 19:17:44 UTC,5,3,0,11,szuSDkvop4LZLmkJ5r6Edg

Upstairs, the layout of the guest rooms was not what I was expecting at all. They are so spacious and incredibly luxurious. Plus the views are spectacular.

In attending the Mothers Day Brunch the experience was not worth the price of admission.

The staff are great! The hotel is beautiful! This isn't your usual conference hotel...far from it. Bottleworks is a boutique hotel situated in the bottleworks district of Mass Ave. The hotel is in the old Coca Cola bottling factory hence the name. 

The halls are lined with floor to ceiling images of the women and men who built the hotel in a commanding display of art and reality. It is both beautiful and inspiring. 

We visited the cafe after check-in which doubles as a pop-up bar creating handmade craft cocktails. We sat on the patio and enjoyed our drinks as we waited for our reservation at Modita, the newest Cunningham restaurant iteration that is Asian inspired and set in the Bottleworks Hotel. I'll review the restaurant on their Yelp page. 

We ordered room service on Saturday morning enjoying a basket of pastries and coffee. The croissant was flaky and the homemade berry jelly fantastic. The muffins were equally tasty. 

We plan to explore Mass Ave on Saturday starting at the far end and working our way back towards the hotel to enjoy The Garage food hall Saturday night. I'll review The Garage later as well though I expect to sample a Clancy's burger, Chapati, and Axle's Garage Tap at a minimum. I'm sure we'll find some dessert as well though we did bring the Coke Cake back to our room from Modita so that's an option too!

We told the group of 5 wanna-be clowns running the stand that we wanted to go out 2 at a time.

The outside of the building is a beautiful limestone with brick sidewalks that lead you to the Garage, the soon to be shopping center full of local businesses. There is also an old fashioned movie theater that just opened next to it, Living Room Theaters.

While the fun surroundings make for a perfect location, the inside of the hotel has its own gems. The lobby is stunning. As you walk in, the hotel bellhops greet you and hold open the heavy bronze doors. The first thing you'll notice might be the colorful array of tiled walls or the red velvet couch. But the thing that surprised me most was the smell of the building. It was this musky pine cologne smell that made me want to cozy up in bed and read a good book. 

The rest of the hotel was just as stunning. I took a tour before booking my stay. The girl who gave us a tour showed us the grand stair case. A spectacular spiral stair case made of marble steps and steel railings. She then showed us the restored offices of the two brothers who owned the plant, which will be used as conference rooms. Something that was quite unique was the bottling room, a floor to ceiling teal tiled room used for capping the bottles. I just loved that they restored these rooms to their former glory making them special to this hotel's history. 

Other highlights of the tour included the second floor corridors that had beautiful black and white photos of people from the past and present. In fact some of the people on the walls were construction workers from when the hotel was being renovated. Photography seemed to be a continued theme of this floor as there is an old school photo booth at the end of the second floor with a wall decorated with old and new cameras. 

After taking the tour, I booked my stay in a double Queen room for NYE. The room felt more like a luxury apartment than a hotel room. Everything was so finely selected from the cute little red velvet pillows to the mini bar stocked with local spirits. And don't get me started about the amazing bathroom! The double shower head along with marble and hold fixtures made you feel like you were showering like royalty. All of these details really made the stay that more special.

To sum it up, this stay was pretty amazing. But it wouldn't have been a 5 star stay if it weren't for the staff. I cannot believe how well run this hotel is for just opening. Everyone who worked there from the bellhops to the front desk management were professionals who treated every guest with respect and kindness. I have to give a special recognition to Kayla who gave us the tour. If it wasn't for her taking the time to show us the hotel and sharing so much about the history and future of the hotel, we would have never known how truly special Bottleworks is. 

Whether you are from out of town or just looking for a staycation like me, I hope you find this review helpful and chose to stay at Bottleworks.",2021-01-02 15:42:15 UTC,5,2,0,4,KQgQDk_Hv4LE0G8imHQqzg

They sent me this whole elaborate email stating I had to give them all this info to get our names in the system. Went through all of it and confirmed we were in their system. Then, 6 months before my wedding I called to make sure it was still there. They then told me they didn't have my name anywhere in their system. I went back through all of it again, to make sure.

I then called and spoke to the manager, telling him what was going on, and he rambled things that weren't relevant as to the fact NONE of my guests were able to get a room.

The Residence Inn, is usually consistent when it comes to the rooms and service. This location happens the fall just below the others. The room was smaller than what I've come to expect from a RI that was a bit disappointing. While visiting Tampa with the fam this was not the most ideal room. If you're traveling alone or with a loved one on business or pleasure it should be just fine. 

The Internet was slow if or when it connected, the enhanced internet (extra fee) is the way to go if you need to go online. Good luck getting through a full movie in the room without lagging every few minutes. 

The location was hard to beat, if anything, that alone is good reason to stay here. it's in the center of downtown, close to the interstate and almost everything Tampa has to offer. 

Service was good overall. The staff did what they could to accommodate. They were friendly and hospitable. 

As far as housekeeping goes.. where do I start? This was my first stay in a Hotel post COVID and I'm now learning that (apparently) housekeeping is no longer a thing. Only offered upon request. After our first two nights, the room was in need of attention so I made my request to have our room serviced only to come back after a long day and find the room the same way I left it, Wtf ! 

The housekeeper came by after I placed a second request the following day, all they did was change the sheets and replenish the towels. No trash pick up, no clean dishes, no vacuum, all used towels were left on the bathroom floor. It was as half assed job to say the least.

Last but not least was the parking. Its $22 to park, the parking is Taylor made for compact vehicles, its park at your own risk, also, there's a good chance you may not find a spot after you return from a night out as parking is limited. 

Everything else is pretty standard as far as the courtyard, pool area , basketball, Gym etc. All things considered, it's no more than a 2.5 star Experience.

He mumbled at me when I entered the building and when I asked him to repeat himself he sharply did so, but in a tone that indicated I was some sort of idiot for just wanting the initial employee's name. Finally, after asking 5 times, I got her name. It's ""Du"" apparently. 

I work in customer service. I've had those days where you just don't want to work. Or maybe you're going through something which makes it hard to keep a smile on your face. I get that. We would've been totally happy with at least sub-par service because we are really understanding people. But what I don't think was considered in these interactions is that we, as tourists, started our trip by being spoken to like children. It had a lasting effect on our trip and I was honestly close to tears by the end of this interaction. Not a great way to celebrate my birthday. I hope ""Du"" and her team see this review and just think about the effect they can have on people's lives. Yeah, it's just a car rental. It was a 10 minute moment in my life, but it made me feel like I was not welcome here, as it was my first interaction with someone from here. 

Really looking forward to being cursed-out when we bring this car back :D",2021-11-07 17:37:23 UTC,1,0,0,0,ymbZcd8TBPRjwWWVRGZWYw

Not my style to post negative reviews but you should know a few things if you are looking to make a reservation.
1) Noisy hotel from the birds at night, noisy hotel guests above the room, Loud air conditioner to sprinklers hitting the window in the early morning.  
2) The worst sleep for a hotel that should have been called a motel.  
3) Overly priced hotel for $$$$ per night was a complete rip off. We were scheduled to stay for 6 nights as a family, left after the 3rd night with lack of sleep. We booked a 5 star hotel down the street for a few dollars less per night.

Getting to the hotel is easy and right on the ocean. Beautiful scenery. Valet was easy and the gentleman who helped us was very friendly. There is a strip of grass dividing two of the hotel buildings that the public is open to, which is nice for picnics. The rooms don't have much sound proofing, so the nights my partner and I stayed there we were awoken by construction. The rooms themselves were very clean and spacious for 2 adults, the bathroom was a little small to my liking, especially the shower. The pool/hot tub were far from our room so it was a little inconvenient, but we enjoyed our time soaking. The hotel does offer free access to bicycle rentals, I very much loved this, but wished I had checked my tire level before heading off. If you enjoy the night life of SB on state street, the restaurants are not too far of a walking distance away. If you are wanting to do some shopping further down state st. it is a little bit of a walk, as far as I can recall it was about a 15-20 min. walk. Overall, we had a great time, the staff were very pleasant and we didn't mind the walking distance. There are a few museums in walking distance, a cool one we found was the Santa Barbara Maritime museum (for kids), but as 2 adults, we enjoyed it very much (highly recommend going to the top floor for the amazing view!!!).",2021-12-08 07:22:36 UTC,3,0,0,0,TkRiHo7-3DT1eWVDX_mLlQ

-I booked using a combo of miles+cash through American Airlines. I paid for two ocean view rooms, but when I called the hotel to confirm they told me that they couldn't give me these rooms since they don't control the third party website that I used to book.
-I booked two rooms since I would be attending a wedding in SB and needed my parents to look after my newborn daughter (our first hotel night away from home). I called 3 times to confirm that the two rooms would be next to each other on the first floor and was told each time that everything was all set. I even spoke to the manager on one of those occasions (or so I was told).
-Upon arrival I was told that they had no record of my calling and no notes on my account. As a result, they did not have two rooms close together. To add insult to injury, they charged close to an additional $600 on my credit card AND my mother's card for some reason that I still do not understand. Both charges were eventually waved, but it added unnecessary time and confusion.
-I spoke to the manager who at one point suggested I look for another hotel that might have rooms closer together. This was at 2:30p.m. and the wedding was at 4:00p.m. Suggesting that I leave the hotel after I had already paid for two rooms and search for another hotel in SB with my baby was absurd.
-They eventually gave us two rooms that were in the same building, but not close together. The rooms themselves were absolutely terrible - dirty, dark, and tiny. We had no other choice than to stay and make it work since we were already late to the wedding.

Our first night away with our baby was incredibly stressful and disappointing. If you are visiting the SB area, there are SO many hotels to choose from. I urge you not to give your business to this hotel.",2021-08-25 09:18:05 UTC,1,0,0,0,JpZ5CeVK4QTCcEllJ1hS5A

I haven't written any review in many many  years but after a stay here felt compelled to do so.  I'm extremely frustrated when a hotel posts pictures that are deceiving to customers, and this is what this hotel has done. The Ocean View room looked much larger online and much nicer. 

Firstly, this is NOT a hotel. It is a MOTEL. Meaning you have to access your room from the outside.  We paid over $300 for an ""ocean view room"" which is a joke. (And then an additional $30/for parking). The room is very small (#201) and other than a little table with 2 chairs there's no place to sit other than the bed. There's literally no closet, other than a very tiny wardrobe that holds a couple of house coats. It's an older hotel so the walls are paper thin and you can hear the noise and people coming and going from their units. This is an old motel that they've put lipstick on and are milking it because of it's location across from the beach. This is what many of the beachfront hotels are in Santa Barbara. 

PROS
1) Across from the beach and good access to funk zone.
2) About a mile walk to get to the heart of State Street
3) Our room was clean (albeit not the door handles) 
4) Bikes are free to use and readily available.

CONS
1) This is a MOTEL as stated above, Have to access your room from outside 
2) Nowhere to put your suitcases. Would be nice to have luggage racks so you don't have to bend down.
3) No storage
4) No place to put toiletries in the bathroom. The sinktop is very tiny. IT WOULD BENEFIT THE ROOM To HAVE A SMALL NARROW TABLE BESIDE THE SINK where one could put toiletries and you could have extra towels. 
5) The shower door kept popping open
6) Being an old motel, there's no central heating or a/c - it's a wall mounted unit
7) Like many hotels, cleaning a room involves making a bed, cleaning a bathroom and  sweeping the floor. However,  how many of then actually wipe down the door handles and doors, wipe the TV remote, the bathroom handles and the actual toilet flush handle. (Yes I'm picky) Given the Covid sham scare you'd think this would be one of the most important things they'd do to prevent germs. 
8) No elevators given it's a motel so you have to walk up stairs to your room.

The fire pits are nice albeit  it was too cool for us to use them. Again, it would benefit the hotel to offer Smores to make up for the lack of other amenities. 

I would NOT stay here again. Next time we come I'd try Hotel Californian or an Airbnb.",2021-11-09 16:56:13 UTC,2,0,0,3,jUQ1D5wjvC8jI3N6GxqkeA

We had to use our towels to clean up the water and with no housekeeping services this left us with no clean towels. The room was small, outdated and the bathroom was ridiculously tiny and old - none of the plumbing fixtures worked properly.

It's very different than what you see in the advertisements. Rooms are small and not up to date. All this would be fine considering it's on the beach, but my rating is fully based on the customer service. The service is the WORST. The staff is rude and disrespectful. It almost feels like they do not value their jobs. They made us feel very uncomfortable and unimportant. I stayed here with my family two nights and we ended up buying a resort pass for another nearby hotel to spend the day at their pool because the service was so bad at Hotel Milo. Why keep giving them money? 

There's no room service, no daily cleaning of the rooms and the walls are paper thin. If you're willing to spend 800+ a night do NOT do it here. My biggest regret was not reading these other ratings sooner. It looks beautiful in the photos and priced at a 5 star rate so I just booked. I'm hoping this helps other families in the future and keeps you from making the same mistake.

When we arrived, the gentlemen at the front desk were really wonderful, made things super easy and everything was very smooth. They gave us an Ocean View room which looked out towards the Harbor. 

The problem I have is that the pictures on their website and other travel websites don't really represent what the actual experience is like. The rooms, while really clean, have a run down quality to them. The bathrooms feel very much like a motel - and the bed wasn't the more comfortable in the world. 

If they advertised ""Upscale Motel on the Santa Barbara Harbor"" and they were less expensive, I wouldn't hesitate to give this a 5 star review. However because of the high price and misleading photo's - I feel compelled to warn people so they can set expectations. 

Ultimately, if you get find a good deal on this place and want a wonderful location and nice staff - knowing the rooms feel like Motel rooms, you should book this place.

Every staff member we have encountered has been genuinely welcoming and kind. 
To start, Austin in Valet greeted my boyfriend, Devin and I as we pulled into the parking lot. Austin was so kind and hospitable as he offered to help us with our bags. 
Sutton checked us in and automatically offered us a complimentary upgrade since we are celebrating my birthday and our anniversary. Sutton explained all the restrictions clearly and concisely due to COVID which are: no breakfast, no wine hour, no hot tub- which resulted in no resort fee (which is much appreciated). He also explained that parking is $30/night, which we waived since we are on a budget and found street parking. 
We borrowed bicycles from Austin in Valet and biked to Sandspit surfbreak and then down the bike path towards Montecito. The bikes are great and the hotel provides locks and helmets if you want.
We are staying in a King Deluxe suite downstairs and love it. There is a desk, a closet, a mini fridge, plenty of outlets for chargers, a large bathroom area with a tub and great shower water pressure. One touch I love is that you can easily connect to Chromecast to watch Netflix, Hulu, etc. The bed is very comfortable and we could not be happier (The sheets are so comfortable that Devin wants to buy the same brand of sheets). 
The first room we stayed in had an unwanted cricket visitor (I know it sounds silly, but they make so much noise) and the AC wasn't working so Kezai, the supervisor, came quickly to assist us. He kindly offered to move us to the room next door after troubleshooting the AC system. Kezai made us feel seen, heard and special! He left the kindest note and some wine for the ""trouble."" Such great hospitality and much appreciated!

The shower only had one glass sliding thing, I read reviews saying that it was hard to keep the water inside but if you take a normal shower you shouldn't get water everywhere. I was fine showering.

As mentioned in many of the previous reviews, the staff is really delightful and goes above and beyond at every opportunity.
When I checked in Isaac was at the front desk and couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful!
I have a very comfortable room,  with a fantastic view of the ocean, that also includes a fireplace and a small fridge.
There are many outdoor areas with plenty of seating as well as warm and cozy fire pits in the evening.
The hotel has 2 different pools to enjoy, and both have cabanas so one can get a break from the sun.
Adorable retro bicycles are available to borrow free of charge.
In response to some of the rather unfair reviews I read, many of which were posted after a long holiday weekend when the hotel was likely at maximum capacity, I would say the following: 
I have traveled a great deal and I have never been to a hotel that  didn't have some sort of noise (it is impossible to control other guests slamming their doors etc.) so I always make sure to wear earplugs when I'm ready to go to sleep. 
They have them available here at the front desk if you didn't happen to bring your own.
While there are certainly many hotels in Santa Barbara to choose from, I think that Hotel Milo's location and quality of service is hard to beat.

My boyfriend and I booked a king size room for one night, July 1st-2nd, 2021. The room was HORRIBLE. They obviously did NOT clean the room before our arrival. There was trash(fake rose petals, empty mini alcohol bottles, and food wrappers) on the side of the bed.  The sheets were not clean. When asked about it they said (during a pandemic ) they clean rooms every THREE days. The hotel is very outdated and has a strange moth-ball like smell. Little stuff like the plugs being upside down, bathtub/sink not being cleaned, dingy furniture, and a dirty office chair in room was the LEAST disturbing thing. I had my ipad in my room and somehow it ends up in the managers office.

Today, that inefficiency is Septa transportation. 
            I started my trip to see my cousin nothing short of optimistic. I had a great workout on my girlfriends mother's peloton, had a great shower, my girlfriend had just picked out my clothes and dressed me nicely, I had no complaints in the world. I arrived at the train station, and it was completely vacant. Is there anyone I can talk to about how these magical trains run? They don't exist in Nashville. I sit in the parking lot for 10 minutes, optimism still pretty high. 

              The train finally comes 6 minutes late, and an unkind middle aged obese white male (the worst kind of white male for the ""woke leftists"" out there) opens the train doors and yells ""CASH ONLY OR KEY CARD"" I kindly explain I do not have cash or a key, no signs identified it was cash only or key, and the younger generations do not run on cash. He yelled out ""SORRY BUD, if you don't have cash or key you can't hop on board!"" And kept the train moving. 

              Back to my original statement: ""I have come to accept I will live my life disappointed with inefficiencies that the world offers"" 

              How would this system improve, a ""scholar"" or ""expert"" may ask? 

             1) have a train station Venmo, cash app, zelle, Bitcoin, gofundme, onlyfans, whatever source available to give money. You cannot expect to operate like it is 1990, the world is constantly adapting. As a business or human, it is your job to analyze the adaptation and make it advantageous to yourself. This man and this business failed. 

              2) if idea 1 is too rational, have signs EVERYWHERE saying ""CASH ONLY"". 
              2a) if you are going with idea two (a worse idea, but better than no idea) , have on speakers ""CASH OR KEY CARD ONLY"" every minute and have an ATM and key card machine at every train station. Even if it's a robbery ATM (every ATM that wants $3 or more is a robbery ATM) it's better than no ATM. 
               3) have a square card that you can swipe with, if many Uber drivers can obtain the $49 square card how in the world can you not? 
               4) technology is the future, either ""hop on board, Venmo, cash, credit card and onlyfans accepted!"" or die a slow painful death. And BAD news septa, you don't get the nice death our ancestors got when you failed to successfully hunt or gather food and the whole family starved. Today, it is often a 30-50 year process of slow degeneration, loss of value, loss of reputation, and then best case, being bought out by someone intelligent who could run the business successfully, and worst case, you go bankrupt and board up the windows and sell the property to mice, bugs, and dust.

Ford apparently stands for Found On Road Dead, since their airbags don't work and their service department doesn't care about fixing them.

I set an appointment a week ago to fix my ford ranger airbag for the second time, along with refilling refrigerant.

Did not expect to be dealing with total snakes, but here we are.

I was quoted $140 for the work.  The tech asked his supervisor if the 'free' airbag replacement would be covered by the dealership in front of me.  They both laugh a bit about something that I didn't hear.  Miraculously, several seconds later the total increased to $190.  While it's not 100% certain they did this unethical nonsense, I think it's highly probable based upon the interaction that they indirectly charged me for a FREE service that covers their defective trucks.

On top of this, it took 15 minutes to drop off my keys for this appointment.  Literally wasted my time for a 30 second interaction.

The cherry on top is that they DIDN'T EVEN ORDER THE AIRBAG when I scheduled the appointment, they ordered it when I dropped off the car, wasting a half of a week or so of my time.  They wanted me to pick up my truck WITHOUT THAT WORK BEING DONE and didn't let me know that the work wasn't done until I asked (they said I could come pick it up today, despite this key repair not being made).  Mind you, this airbag issue is literally leading to people dying.  No ethics here.

Don't buy a Ford, and if you make that mistake, don't come here for service.

EDIT:
A week later, they still don't have the airbag.  They again told me the truck was ready when it was not.  Called them and they hung up on me.  Spoke with Corporate, and hopefully this issue gets resolved.  By far the worst dealership i've been to, but i'm thankful that corporate stands by its name.

Overall environment felt somewhat exclusive and trendy. The staff here was very polite and provided quick service. My boyfriend and I ordered the scallop toast, braised pork shoulder, and the 404 burger. 

The scallop toast was my favorite part of the meal. The presentation was beautifully done with the avocado piped onto the toast with bits of lemon, scallop, and microgreens decorating the top. I liked that the toast was nicely divided into 4 pieces making it very easy to eat. The flavor had a lot of depth to it. It was creamy, buttery, with hints of lemon. The scallop's flavor was not too overwhelming nor was it fishy. Overall, very well done!

The braised pork shoulder could have had better presentation. It didn't look appetizing as it was a grey slop with different ingredients thrown in. The flavor was lacking in many ways. There were a lot of other ingredients in the meal but I would describe it as a semi bland, incredibly salty, pork soup. I'd say the only redeeming quality of this dish was the fact that the pork was cooked to be soft and tender.

The 404 burger looked very appetizing! The fries were garnished with parmesan and sliced very delicately. The texture was very light, crisp, and airy which nicely contrasted the heavy looking burger. However, it was incredibly salty as well! The amount of salt ruined the overall light airiness of the fries. Moving on to the burger, it was larger than expected! I was very pleased by that. However, when I took my first bite I could not help but notice the overwhelming flavor of oil. The burger was dripping in oil which was not pleasant to bite down into. Even though the initial flavor of the burger was fine, I can hardly remember it since the flavor of the oil drowned out the burger. As appetizing the meal looked, I was very disappointed in the flavor. 

Overall, everything except the scallop toast was too salty and left a somewhat negative impression on me. I'd say the food is decent. It's not terrible but it wasn't the best either. Would a nice place for a date but I would not come back here unless it was for the scallop toast and drinks.",2021-08-14 23:50:45 UTC,3,1,1,2,xRkky9QysPmHWTCfnuAelw

We spent $600 here and we were very disappointed. The one star was for the impeccable service that was provided by Scott, our waiter, otherwise there would be zero. We were a party of four and started with standard cocktails that were fine.  We ordered the cornbread as an appetizer and it was burnt on the bottom. We were told it was supposed to be toasted on top, which it was, and then some, but we were famished so we ate it. We then ordered from the Shareables section of the menu: the whole smoked and fried chicken ($48) and the Kobe 12 day aged Prime ribeye ($8/oz.). We were advised that there was only a 32 and 36 oz. ribeye available, and since there were four adults, we went for it, and ordered it medium rare. The steak was presented on a wooden board with Giardiniera. It was undercooked, under salted (IMO) and there was perhaps an entirety of 12 oz. of edible meat on the platter. Between the bone and the amount of fat on this steak (sliced by the kitchen), we were grateful we also ordered the chicken. $256 for any steak is a tremendous splurge at any time, but since we were celebrating our 20th anniversary with this trip to Nashville, so we went for it. The chicken had an overpowering smoky flavor and the batter was flavorless. Great idea, and the portion was large, but I couldn't eat more than one leg because of the smoke flavor. Perhaps I just don't like smoky flavor, so be prepared if you're like me. The atmosphere was lovely, again the service was great, but the food itself was very underwhelming and we did not get what we paid for, hence this review.",2021-09-11 14:47:03 UTC,1,0,0,1,u9x9_c8P5lFQGJLla4XlpQ

I won't spend too long on the service - though it was underwhelming. The hostess barely paid us any mind upon entry and we weren't greeted by our server for far too long after we were seated. She walked by us several times before even looking at us. This could have been because the hostess placed us directly next to a large, loud party which kept our server busy. That did leave us scratching our heads because the rest of the restaurant was fairly empty. We just aren't used to this as the majority of service we have received in Nashville has been superb. We chalked it up to it being a bad night for staff...but based on reviews, they may have a little bit of an issue here.

The real forgettable factor for us was the food. It wasn't just forgettable - it was bad. None of it came out hot. All tasted like it had sat out for a bit. I ordered the burger and fries which was subpar. Nothing exciting at all and certainly not worth the price tag. The other dish ordered was the steak au poivre with fingerling potatoes. The steak looked unappetizing and dry. It was. Lukewarm at best. I didn't try the fingerling potatoes as they looked shriveled up. They were apparently also dry and flavorless.

Should have trusted my gut with other low reviews and a mostly empty restaurant on a Saturday evening. I'm always willing to give places a shot and sometimes a second chance but we will not return here. It is just too overpriced for what you get. It was frustrating to pay the bill at the end to be honest. Nashville has some stellar restaurants with great food AND awesome service that are worth saving your money for.

The 404 kitchen was one of the best restaurants we have experienced. 

The atmosphere was casual upscale. Clean, trendy and nicely decorated. We had cocktails and they were innovative and had plenty of kick. 

The food was the star though. We shared the cavatelli, the scallop toast and the Brussel sprouts. The Brussel sprouts were addictive. Salty and seasoned and cooked exactly the right amount.  Soft but not mushy and the outer leaves were a little crispy. 

The scallop toast was rich and filling but still tasted fresh. The pasta was not out of a box and the mushrooms added a very nice earthy flavor. 

The service was great. We went a bit early, so it was full, but not crowded.

They have had our BRAND NEW 2021 camper for almot THREE months now. The last phone call we had was from Tabitha two weeks ago!

We have had reservations to take a trip to Georgia for two months now. We leave Monday! My husband has called multiple times with no luck to speak with anyone who could give us answers so he has left message after message with not a single return call from ANYONE! He called again this morning and asked for the Service Manager, left another message, with no response, of course. So he called in the afternoon asking to speak to the General Manager and was told he was off on Thursday's. So he asked to speak with Jacqueline who is the customer service representative who he last spoke with and  is the ONLY person who has returned our calls.

We will never use this place again, not for repairs, not for anything.  Mr. Good if you want to speak to us, please call my husband his number is on file.

Pretty nice location surrounded by tons of shops and food. At first site, the exterior is nothing to be excited about but you walk into a beautiful, modern hotel on the inside with a gorgeous outdoor pool area. 

Then you actually stay and you see everything from the rooms, to the halls to the pool area is all barely cleaned. The floors in every space look like they haven't been simply vacuumed or mopped. Our room had random hair everywhere and the floor wasn't vacuumed. We moved to a new room and low and behold there's hair! The AC didn't work and clearly looked banged up and yet they still put us in this room. 

The cafe doesn't even operate so if you chose this location for that, be ready to be disappointed. Despite advertising  Starbucks menu, all they provide is diluted Starbucks brewed coffee in an urn. 

We asked to have some amenities turned on and was told none of the workers actually know how to turn on the amenities provided.

If you have no other choice but to stay here, just bring some cleaning materials to do a super basic cleaning of your own room, cause the hotel isn't going to do that for you.

They contacted the third party company who is responsible for registering out of state vehicles and went as far as contacting the CEO of the company! They had him call me personally and he oversaw the process.

It was the worst experience in sales I have ever experienced. March 23, 2021 I flew to Tampa, Fl from California to finalize the sale and take delivery of the coach. I arrived at this Dealership for my 11:00am scheduled appointment, my salesmen know my logistical situation as far as flying in to pickup the motor home, and driving it back to California. The purchase price and loan terms where agreed upon 
 prior to me even purchasing my plane ticket. I waited 2 1/2 hours to get my orientation defects where found so now I'm told ""it has to go back to the chassis dealer. I waited another 2 1/2 I was offered water.  I was given a due bill (IOU) to fix the problem. Now it's time to sign documents. I had already been there 5 hours the Purchase price was incorrect which I hadn't noticed because they sold me all theses service agreements and warranties. Before showing me the contract and when I saw the contact and asked about the price I was told that's the price after adding the service agreement. Shouldn't they have started with the purchase price and go over the contract explaining the other charges? It's going on 5:30pm I'm a diabetic and only offered a candy bar and water all I wanted to do was leave. So I get the motor home and get a few miles down the street and noticed it only had a 1/4 tank of gas. If anyone plane's on flying into pickup an RV from here check your documents.

I complained. Well here to inform you 6 months later situation is the same. 


Pathetic I bought a car here 10k miles ago and the headlight already out but 75$ for a new bulb lmao I'm getting my whole fcking car serviced for $100 lol comical place to get your car serviced. 

They really might not have any clue on how customer service works. 

Lol I complain about the light bulb price dude goes how much are those shoes. Uh my sneakers price is irrelevant lol regardless this price of the bulb is near criminal.

I bought a new Toyota Camry here years ago and ordered a certain color pinstripe. When I went to pick up the car, the pinstriper had done it in a color he thought would look better! Since when does someone paid to do a job make a decision like that? At that time, they took a photo of you when you bought a new car, and I still have it showing how upset I was. 

Now I have another Camry that's just over 2 years old.  It replaced the car I had for almost 20 years, and it's my third Toyota. The leather on the steering wheel is coming apart and they don't want to replace it. It should be under warranty, but Tri-County kicks responsibility to Toyota corporate, who kicks responsibility to Tri-County. Not to mention that the car has a recall on it and I received a letter informing me that it could be more prone to accidents, but they have no resolution to the problem yet!

What it really comes down to is they sure don't build the cars the way they used to. And this dealership should be working harder to make sure that their customer is satisfied and taken care of. This car was A LOT of money for a Camry (an XSE model), and should not be coming apart after only 2 years.

His birthday trip ruled. The man working was ultra friendly and wanted to just let the boys have fun. These are baseball players so golf was a new challenge. It was fun watching them struggle at first to find their swing. Toward the end one of them pulled a baseball bat put of their pants (yes I'm aware of how that sounds) end they took turns throwing a golf ball up and hitting it. The guy working was cracking up at them and encouraging them. We had dinner delivered to the range by Grubhub, sat outside and ate, sang happy birthday with candles and all, it was fantastic. Fast forward to last week when we visiting the range after a day at the pool. 

Upon arriving and trying to pay the older gentleman working was kind of cranky. He was inside the AC building with the doors still locked leaving us in the heat, so we were taken aback by his mood right away. He kept telling me to read the sign for questions, so I did. He asked how many clubs I wanted. My choice on the sign was 1, 3, or 5. I had two kids so I went with 3 clubs. The guy working got frustrated and asked why I didn't want two. I told him the sign didn't have an option for 2 and he had told me I had to choose what was on the sign. He sighed and wrote me up for 2. He then handed me two slips of paper for my codes to get the balls. He was very stern on the rules. Go to the machine, push in ONLY the code on the paper. Do not push any other buttons at all. When it asks what size bucket don't push anything just wait. If it asks anything else just wait. I go over and my code starts with a 9. The screen asks bucket size and has the options from 1-3. I look at him and he says ""what did I tell you, only put in your code.""  So I push the 9, look at my paper for the next number and the entire screen fills with black lines. I'm perplexed. I wait. Nothing. I try to type in the whole code, nothing. At this point the man working is arguing with new customers, and I'm still waiting. I finally politely interrupt and tell him the screen is just black lines. When I tell you this man SIGHED slammed outside, literally SNATCHED the papers out of my hand and says ""I'll do it."" Hoooo boy was I a little peeved. It's never great to grab stuff out of a customer hand. He goes to the machine. Pushes in my code. Black screen. Pushes more. Still black. Looks at me and says ""what did you do?"" Essssscuse me sir!!  He gets more upset grabs two buckets goes in back and fills them up. Slams back in to help the other guys and fills their bucket by hand. Much later the old man comes up to me and says ""you were right it wasn't your fault, the other guy who works showed up and said it's been doing this all week.""  I told him I knew it wasn't my fault. He said ""okay I just wanted to come over and tell you that you didn't break it.""  I knew that. He did NOT say sorry for the attitude or snatching papers from my hand. The boys had a great time golfing but it started to heat up so at the end they were swinging balls pretty fast and goofing around.  The began tossing the ball up, and when it came close to the turf they would swing. Suddenly the old man came over and told them to knock it off, they could hurt someone, points to the only other people near them two stations away and tells them the ball could hit them. Then he told them it could break the club and I would be liable. This was confusing as they were using the same swing and power they would if they hit it off the tee. He is mainly yelling at my sons friend, I'm sitting behind them laughing honestly because I can't believe these knuckleheads managed to get in trouble. The old man leaves and my son is cracking up because his friend got talked to. 

They both finished their balls and wanted to to. While both trips were fun, I think it was hard to go from having an employee watch a bunch of young kids having a good time in the midst of covid and letting them screw around with their bat, or toss the balls up to hit them, to the other employee who was mad at everything. If anything I would have expected them to get mad about the baseball bat. But tossing the ball up and hitting it with a normal swing as it comes down, didn't seem like a reason to chastise two kids on a lazy week day with no other customers really near them. I think it kind of killed the fun after that because they felt like they would get in trouble if they did anything but a standard swing. I was still frustrated with the employees attitude & didn't even want to go get my ID and return the clubs. I did, the guy was still cranky, and we left. I think before we return we would check to see who is working. 

Overall the range is great because it's outside, and a lot of fun, but this is an example of how employees really matter because two suddenly employees really gave us two different experiences.",2021-06-17 14:03:34 UTC,4,1,0,3,8CJwC_EpulTn0pKxgWxpAQ

I was really upset but they showed me another vehicle in a similar price range and it was damaged all down the passenger side. I test drove it just to see how it was mechanically and it has something off in the suspension/steering. That was it for me.

Who sells cars like this at a dealership? Maybe the average Joe doesn't mind paying $20k for a damaged used vehicle with 70-100k miles. No thanks, I went to Carvana and had a delightful experience.

Buyer beware. Make sure you do your due diligence and thoroughly inspect their used inventory before committing.

My main contact Todd was very detail oriented and carried out all of our tournament needs to a T.  I actually made a surprise visit to the resort for an unscheduled walk-through and was greeted by Gabe in the Sales office who put me in touch with Stephanie who welcomed me into her office before giving me a wonderful tour and solidifying some great options to help our tournament go smooth.  When it came time to have the tournament they did not let down.  The cart signs and scorecards were perfect, the process for checking in and getting warmed up was perfect and of course the courses were in pristine condition.    I would be remiss if I didn't mention the cart girls!  I wish I could remember their names, but that's what happens with a great beverage cart staff!!!  I hope we didn't get too rowdy, but that's what its all about with a great group of friends trying to play golf!  Honorable mention to rest of the F&B staff and seamless process of the Players assistants.  We also had a photographer provided by the resort on day 2 and we all bought memories.

The service overall was great. The starter copped an attitude with us because the staff member in the club house granted us a normal request. The cart's GPS serves as a course marshal. It doesn't allow you to drive silly, go where you should not be, and keeps you going in the right direction.

We grabbed our belongings and we basically moved everything one floor up and within 10mins of us sitting down, Judith calls us and said we need to move to the first floor because she could not authorize a new room without the approval of the manager. Due to her unprofessionalism and lack of hospitality experience, we had to again drag out belongings back to down to the 1st floor. We were ""TOLD"" by Judith that the hotel manager will be in at 9am to speak to us about our issues and concerns, and not once did the hotel manager come to our room to speak to us.  It seems like the front desk is clueless and they do not have a friendly, nor welcoming appearance. 

We HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend that you do not book a stay at the this hotel as you will also have an UNPLEASANT stay filled with noise, bugs, discomfort and most of all a hotel staff that has does not know the meaning of great customer hospitality service.",2022-01-04 05:29:49 UTC,1,0,0,0,q1oj_oRZERKKB7gvZ2rbYg

The individual rooms and props are amazing and I'd love to go back when they change the rooms. Most of the staff were awesome but we felt rushed when we were in the last few rooms. The website clearly says this is a 60 minute experience. At minute 38, we only had 2 rooms left and there was a change in how the staff handled transitioning us between rooms. The time slots are staggered every 15 minutes and we were confused when people in the group after us started making their way in the rooms we were in. It happened twice and the employee didn't do anything to stop it. That was irritating because I paid to buy out the entire slot so my family would feel comfortable. I hate that an otherwise good experience had to end that way.

I was a little disappointed with the front desk because they were unusually disinterested when i checked in and checked out, even though I was the only one there. Although I checked in online, I had to ask for a physical key to access the pool. So I asked for 2 keys and a couple bottles of water. The person working rolled her eyes when I asked, and then only provided me with one key. When I asked for another one, she asked if I really needed one, to which I said yes, and she obliged. But still did not give me the waters! So I just gave up at that point for anything else. 

My only other gripe was the shower drain was clogged, causing the tub to fill with water. That's a shame bc you know it's someone else's hair, buggers and whatever that the water is sitting on top of:(  The room otherwise was spacious and clean. Then upon check out, I told a different front desk rep about the shower issues and he too was indifferent. So I had to drop a star due to all of that. 

Otherwise we loved the hotel. The indoor pool was really nice and clean and the little restaurant ""Bur Bun"" was excellent! The server/bar tender was all over the place helping guests and was super friendly, especially considering she had no help and they were pretty busy! It's basic hamburgers, sandwiches and bar fare, with an expansive a bourbon selection. The food was terrific and the pours were solid. I'd stay here again just for the restaurant!",2021-03-13 21:17:37 UTC,4,0,0,0,ayPKqZUJQwMDBfBFSgLiDw

First things first...bring your VAX CARD or negative COVID-19 test results within 3-days or they won't let you in! Period.

Anywho...the 1st 4 rooms were a guided tour which was nice especially the snippet about the Mardi Gras Bone & Skull crew. The staff was friendly and helpful throughout the experience. I loved the music vibe and vibrant colors and textures of each exhibit. I appreciated that they only allow 10 ppl in the building between tours. That made us feel safe and socially distanced. The rest of the tour was self-guided, full of eclectic art, NOLA culture and history. You might find yourself taking selfies in every room!  No complaints here.

Due to COVID they are limiting tour groups to six and spacing out the time slots so that they have time to clean in between. Masks are required while inside even in pictures which I appreciated (I know, I know, but your IG aesthetic will totes be okay, I promise!).

This is definitely a must-do if you enjoy creative works of local artists. Just make sure to channel your ""inner photographer"", because you will definitely get some great pictures here! 

10 people is the maximum amount of people in a group per session, so make sure to plan accordingly. This allows for social distancing and perfect for preventing the exhibit from getting too crowded. 

I really enjoyed doing this experience, but the negative is that I felt a little rushed. In the beginning a guide made a good introduction and explained some of the pieces. After about ten minutes, no one was guiding us anymore except to move along to the next room. Didn't like how we were left alone to explore. Probably would  have a better appreciation for the pieces if a little background was given.

All in all, JAMNOLA is definitely worth checking out when in New Orleans.",2021-05-27 02:05:17 UTC,4,2,0,2,YLPk28ugJBT5NRkttrXkaQ

I went with my friend on a Friday night and it wasn't busy at all (methinks everyone was getting drunk on Bourbon St or something, so yay); we saw maybe 2 other groups max the entire time we were in there, so we had plenty of time to maneuver and have each room all to ourselves. The rooms are quite intricate and very visually appealing with different activities; the holiday themed one, the one where you watch a movie to get a bit of history in, the lobster pot/bath room, the psychedelic mirror room, etc. You can tell a lot of effort and real artistry went into making them. I almost died in the prop room where you can take one of those ""boomerang-like"" selfies on a revolving pedestal, but I quickly got the hang of it; STAY VERY STILL LOL. 

The only one we weren't really a fan of was the ""Bling Bayou."" I would have much rather had it fashioned to be a normal swamp than a glittery one.

The service center for Dollar Car Rental is very easy to find.  Just follow the signs.  Since it's a smallish airport, your walk will be minimal. 

Dollar, Hertz and Avis share the same agents and the same customer service line.  My wait was short, but I'm sure that during peak times this could be VERY frustrating. 

After doing the paperwork, the real adventure begins.  Navigating out of the airport is not overly difficult, but the current construction does throw you a curve ball and the directional signs are missing at some points.  Or, I could have just been tired and looked past them. 

Staff member (yes only 1) was friendly and relatively efficient.

Clearly wasn't explained well, as I would never have agreed to an ""extra"" that cost me $102. The fuel purchase option was explained in such a way that I thought I would be charged the current cost per gallon to refill what I used, which was 1/4 tank. Instead, it appears they charged me for an entire tank, regardless of what I used. $50.56 for a Nissan Altima. I should have been wary when the man at the desk kept trying to upsell me to an SUV, despite me repeatedly saying  it would just be me and possibly one other passenger. 

When I went to turn the car in there was no attendant in sight. It was 5:00 am but it was busy as there were many flights going out that morning. At least 3 other people pulled up after me, all of us standing around wondering what to do. So no chance to question what I was being charged for upon checking out.

If you have your own car insurance you do not need to pay extra for any of their options. They will not ask you IF you want the insurance but WHICH ONE you want. You don't want any. Also, do not sign up for them to fill up the gas. You fill it up before you get back. Opt out of all of their extras. It's completely unnecessary. Do not be fooled. 
Also, take pictures of the car inside and out, including the gas and mileage before you leave the lot. Do the same when you get back so they can't say you didn't fill the gas or you caused damage.

She waited the entire time until we went to the wrong floor twice and finally came to tell us and some other people waiting that she needed to check ID's before even sending us up.

I asked to speak to a manager and was told they weren't present and there was no way to reach them (suspicious). 

Had they told me about the credit check I would have forgone a few actions that dinged my credit last month, this was entirely preventable. 

There was a local place down the street (atlas) that was able to get me set up and the rental was cheaper for a bigger car. Moral of the story, do do business with dollar rental at the Nashville airport. 

I did talk to all of the rental companies who were overbooked but empathetic to my plight.

Drinks were fine but definitely overpriced even considering it's basically on Broadway. The food is really where they get you.  I decided to go with a 48 oz porterhouse (med-rare) and a few sides that came in at $16 per to share with another person. 

We had to start with the sides as steak knives were not brought out with the huge piece of meat. One of the sides was supposed to be garlic mashed potatoes. What arrived seemed to be gritty unseasoned instant mashed potatoes. Seriously... no garlic or even a grain of salt. It was borderline insulting. I must say the porterhouse was cooked to the perfect temperature, however, once again, not a spec of seasoning was used on the steak.

We ordered 2 drinks ($32), dozen raw oysters on the half shell ($36), chicken parmigiana, and linguine and clams. Our server asked if we wanted water. Yes, but we didn't know it would cost anything; it cost $9.50. The oysters and drinks were fine.

Both our entrees, however, were horrible. The chicken was dry ($33.50), but the kicker was the server asked if he wanted extra pasta with it, he said yes, and only realized this extra cup of overcooked pasta cost $12 on the bill.

My linguine was blander than bland, hardly any sauce, and the clams appeared steamed and tossed in at the end rather than being cooked in the sauce. I make this dish at home and order it at restaurants often, this was by far the worst, and most expensive at $28.

It turns out our server said it was her first day. It showed, but then, how can a place like this take a chance with terrible service?! When we asked her to wipe our table, she said, ""Oh, I know it was clean..."" Not the point. It was clean when we sat down, but we did have water condensation and some crumbs after our appetizer, and normally a nice restaurant would scoop up our mess without saying anything. Tell us the cost of things when you ask us if we want certain additions (that water would cost $9.50 and extra pasta would cost $12). I can't remember the last time I ordered a pasta dish where I was not offered fresh ground pepper and freshly grated cheese. Oh, did I tell you how bland the linguine was?

However,  Now, the bad -  the lobster bisque was not hot, it was only Luke warm to cool, and had a funky taste.  I couldn't eat it all (and I usually love lobster bisque).  The filet was  cooked just right, but was tasteless and dry.  And, When they brought us our main course, our soup bowls were still in front of us, and the server asked us to push them aside so they could put down our plates.  Really??  A good server is supposed to remove our salad/soup dish before bringing the main course ..... they should not ask us to prep the table for them.

The only thing good about our experience was our waiter who tried to correct all of the kitchens short comings.  We were a party of 17 and sat in the private banquet room.  We were charge $500 just for using the room which wasn't a big deal to us considering it was a NYE dinner.  Unfortunately, the cooks are lost when it comes to cooking steaks to the right temperature which is just embarrassing for a steakhouse of this caliber.  My wife ordered the KC bone in NY strip and it was overcooked to just a touch under well done.  I ordered my 22 oz bone in ribeye medium and it was served to me charred on the outside with absolutely no pink on the inside.  Out of the 8 steaks we ordered, 6 of them had to go back for being cooked at the wrong temp. The sides were ok, nothing great or memorable about them. We had creamed spinach and potatoes au gratin, the potatoes are covered in greasy cheese and sit very heavy as you eat them.  The creamed spinach was ok at best, I've certainly had much better.  We had bacon for the appetizer which had great flavor but was extremely salty.  Wine selection was good and fairly priced.  We ordered the jumbo shrimp cocktail as well and they did not seem too fresh and had a bit of a fishy taste to them even over the cocktail sauce. The waiter was apologetic and mentioned that many tables were sending steaks back for not being cooked right.  I know staffs are working with shortages, especially on NYE but this absolutely ruined my meal and experience.  Not exactly what I had in mind for my last meal of 2021. The waiter was nice and did what he could to fix the situation but by the time the steaks came back out cooked almost right, all the sides were ice cold and not enjoyable to eat with the steaks that had just come out. 

Overall, it was not a great experience and I would have to say, I would not return to any Palm location based on this experience.  Sad, I enjoy steakhouses and frequent those that get it right.  This experience was terrible, the steak was unenjoyable and frankly, it started off my and my groups NYE on the wrong foot.  I hope for the restaurants sake that they figure out the cook situation.  I can't see having to replace so many steaks nightly being a good business model for a steakhouse.",2022-01-04 19:57:19 UTC,2,0,0,1,4YiWRzxy9GNQQFX4ceQMvw

We sat in the bar at a high top (even though there were plenty of open tables in the dining room). It took about 10 minutes to get waters on the table. They didn't bring silverware, napkins, or anything. We ordered an appetizer, 2 entrees and a shareable side. 

We got the calamari about 30 minutes after ordering. It was cold. We still didn't have plates, silverware, or napkins. 

We then got our entrees and finally got silverware and napkins. The filet (which is $50 ala carte) was rare. I had to send back to have recooked to medium rare. My husbands fish was good, but not worth the $50 they charged. 

15+ minutes after our entrees got to the table and my husband had finished his - we got our shareable side.

While it no longer tops my list, my wife and I had an enjoyable experience there last evening. The best part of the evening was our server, Sam. She was delightful.  
Good stiff liquor drinks, but for the price paid, they should be. The Shrimp Bruno appetizer and mixed green salad (with Russian dressing) were good. For entrées my wife ordered the Bourbon Glazed Salmon. It wasn't cooked quite enough (she ordered it well done), but not undercooked enough to send it back. She said it was good, but stopped eating towards the thicker middle. As a side note, our Chocolate Lab Gracie thoroughly enjoyed the undercooked portion with her breakfast this morning. I ordered the 18 oz New York Strip, medium. It was a little overcooked, but not enough to send it back. My pet peeve of the entire evening was that this wasn't an 18 ounce steak. It appeared to be much closer to the 14 ounce ones I have in my freezer at home. I was so looking forward to this huge, extra thick chunk of meat, so I was disappointed when it came out and looked like something I had just taken off my grill at home. However, being prime grade beef, it was delicious. The au gratin potatoes were spot on. On the Brussels Sprouts, they were kind enough to char them for us, and they were very good.

The asparagus was exactly what the menu said: grilled. Not one dash of salt nor sprinkle of oil or butter. It was alone on it's journey to our plate. 

The gnocchi. They insulted pasta unforgivably. What was supposed to be pillows of potato dough floating  in a sea of red sauce, was over cooked, mushy circles in red mud. It was like a dry meatloaf mashed together with potatoes. The server took it right away with complete apologies and French, the manager(?), came and offered his regrets. Very professional and appropriate. 

I do not recommend this place if you're a foodie. But the ambiance is nice.

Our servers were kind and hospitable. The menu and preparation of the food is the target of this review. It seems that the food and pricing is set high and the only reason is because it is a ""steak house."" Sixteen dollars for mashed potatoes and asparagus is ridiculous and even more so when it is prepared with no special skill or ingredients. The asparagus was boiled and covered with butter. The mashed potatoes were bland. Sixteen dollars for the nickel treatment is a shame. My salmon was the same salmon I get at the Piggly Wiggly. It was wiggled out of its shrink wrapper packaging warmed and accompanied with a corn relish, read succotash. Our 2-3 person, 48 ounce porterhouse was okay, but the same as I make on my gas grill at home. If this is the treatment you expect when going to a Landry restaurant then I must not be well versed in ""fine"" dining.

So I call RCI and asked them what their COVID policy was...they only refund the $149 exchange fee I paid them....and they take the 8330 points!

Last September I booked a two-week dream trip to India for July 2021.  Based on the all the (scientific) information being provided concerning the pandemic, planning a trip for my summer break 10 months ahead of time seemed more than safe and reasonable.  The current guidelines via the U.S. Embassy and Consulates in India state, ""travel to India for tourism and most other short-term purposes is still not permitted...and there is no indication that this will change in the short-term.  Indian government travel restrictions remain in place that prevent most US Citizens from entering the country."" Contacted RCI today and ""instant chatted"" with a representative regarding transferring our scheduled resort reservations (in Kumarakom and Jaipur) to the following July, 2022.  She finally was able to secure new reservations for us...then hit me with a $633 charge to be paid today (a sizable amount on a public school teacher/counselor's income).  Was absolutely blown away!  A big chunk of that amount was to pay 2022's RCI annual membership fee -which isn't due until the end of October (7 months IN ADVANCE), along with 'enhanced plan protection' costs.  When I declined this option and stated that I would just keep the July 2021 reservations - though doubtful, yet hoping things MIGHT change over the next 4 months - she indicated that those two weeks had already been released/cancelled!  I insisted that she then give me a refund of my points/exchange fees, as my request to reschedule the trip was due to the still-current global pandemic and India's restrictions on US travel to their country rather than a uniquely personal reason.  She said that wasn't possible.  After all of this, she then had the audacity to question why I would want to give up a ""dream vacation""!!  After a bit, she finally - and seemingly begrudgingly - reinstated my 2021 reservations.  We nonetheless probably still won't be able to go this July...a total wash, but preferred over them re-booking the units I've already paid for without any concern over how their inflexible/insensitive policies have impacted me.

Disappointingly, RCI has most certainly failed in the customer service and global awareness departments.  Perhaps it is why Consumer Affairs rates them with a low, 1.5 stars.  :(",2021-03-21 19:47:11 UTC,1,0,0,0,-DcLezMzIGVvIzZJwLqsgA

I asked RCI, on chat, to put my brothers name on reservation in case I get stuck at the airport and can't get there at check in.  I have already paid for trip protection due to cancelled flights and winter storms.  I don't think I should have to pay an additional $99.00 for adding my brothers name to the reservation.

Reason for such a low rating is they seem to have turned into a money grab.  Just noticed in April they will again be raising exchange booking fees for Points members.  

I'm not quite sure why there's even a fee to be a member since that alone doesn't get you anything and you're going to pay a fee for all transactions anyway, but there is, and the member ship fees increase every couple years.  Then there are booking/exchange/extra vacation fees, and they all increase every couple years.  Then there are guest certificate and point saving fees, and those increase every couple years.  There are a boat load of other fees they charge for other things, and those also increase every couple years.

It's a true nickel and dime operation, and they're really starting to push the limits with how high they're going in fees with such frequent increases.  

Perhaps it would be easier to stomach if they were more flexible with cancellations or booking modifications; you only get 24 hours after booking to cancel without loosing the booking fee.  If you want to save any points after the 24 hour grace period, you can for another fee.  Most reputable large hotel chains give you until 2 or 3 days before arrival to cancel/modify without penalty.  For how costly RCI is becoming, one would almost expect RCI to be on par with such a policy.  Even if cancellations weren't refundable, it would be nice if booking fee credits were issued as standard policy for modifying/rebooking if cancellation was within say a week before check-in.",2021-03-15 23:40:23 UTC,1,0,0,0,YJjWC5ZuLZHp9ixbfererA

we got the room on the 4th floor that was 1 bedroom with a queen and a full bed. for 3 people and a 3 night stay, this was great. the patio is not connected to our room, but you walk into the hallway and head outside. the downstairs patio area is nice also, plenty of seats, greenery and plants to admire. the eleveator works, but is super sketchy.

where the place sucked was the water pressure and the water temp. it was weak and not super hot. we also were greeted in our bathroom by a gift. someone had left a douche in a box here for us. it was on the top shelf behind the toilet. pretty nasty that the staff left it there. our room was clean, we had a fridge that worked fine. also we had a fan and an AC - both worked very well.

This is not ""luxury"" per se, just a comfortable, safe, affordable place to enjoy in New Orleans.  The location could not be better--- just 3-5 minutes away from dozens of enjoyable bars and restaurants on Bourbon and Royal streets.  Far away enough from the center of action so you don't have to hear everything in your room all night.  I stayed in Room 205 and had absolutely no problems with water pressure, temperature, nor wifi, they were all perfect.  The fridge/ freezer were wonderful assets and kept my goodies well chilled.  Sadly, unlike other reviewers, I had no apparitions.  Oh well.  

I would recommend bringing ear plugs if you're there for a festival or special occasion.   It's an older building, and noise carries.   It wasn't a problem this week, but could imagine how drunk people laughing and fighting could be annoying if it was a busy weekend.   

Extra credit and acknowledgement must be given where it is due -- the staff is exceptional.  They are friendly, knowledgeable, helpful, kind.  Dewayne especially is a WEALTH of information and can tell you almost anything about anything in New Orleans (and probably nearly any other subject if you ask). 

[Pro Tip:  The breakfast cafe right across the street  -- Croissant D'Or is amazing!]

However, they allegedly implemented a policy 2 years ago where anybody who resides within a 50 mile radius cannot check in; neither Expedia nor even their own website said so... I only found out at the front desk the hard way after working 11 hours and thoroughly exhausted; I had to spend another hour convincing Expedia to send me a refund.

Even worse? I came back in Feb 2021 and I checked in without any problems! Even more worse? I had no choice but to go to Motel 6, and I swear on my mother's grave that someone that came in behind me with a similar cancellation notice crumpled in his hands, except he spent his last dollars at Super 8 and couldn't even afford to stay anywhere.

Given the above, I've booked a boatload of hotels, Airbnbs and other arrangements before, and I've NEVER heard of such a policy!

We arrived around 10 AM and planned to just park and head into the city, but when I went in to confirm with the front desk that it was okay to leave my vehicle prior to check-in, they informed me that they had rooms available, gave me the keys and allowed us into our room. Very impressed with that, and it was a precursor of a very nice stay. This is a pretty good property, as long as you come in with your expectations appropriately set.

 ***PROS*** -Very good location! There's very little in the immediate vicinity (although Cherry St. Pier is right across the street and D&B's is right down the road), but it's an easy 15-20 minute walk or a $10 Uber to Old City or a 10 minute to Penn's Landing. -Views! Be sure to pony up the few extra $$$s for a Riverview room. It's worth it! -Room condition. Our room was exactly what we expect from a HIE: clean, comfortable, plenty of room. Nothing fancy, but it delivers what it promises!

 ***CONS*** -It can get LOUD here. Half the rooms face I-95, the river view rooms face Columbus Boulevard. Staying on a Friday night, there were quite a few street races and ATVs blasting down the Boulevard off and on from about 10 PM all the way to 2-3 AM. Even on the 6th floor and with the sound machine that we travel with on, we were woken up several times. -Parking. At $30 a night, it's pricey for open lot parking. You DO get unlimited in-and-out privileges, but still. -Breakfast Buffet safety. It was nice to see a nearly fully stocked breakfast buffet again, but there were very little mitigation measures in place, and no one present to correct the guests who ignored what Was expected (several guests walking back up to the buffet maskless, touching items then putting them back, etc.). 

All in all, we enjoyed our stay here. It did exactly what we hoped it would do as a home base for some Old City sightseeing for a family. The noise was a significant issue, but there's very little that management can do about that. Bring a sound machine, some ear plugs and plenty of hand sanitizer (and maybe your own breakfast!), and I think you'll be pleased with your choice.",2021-11-14 20:58:28 UTC,4,7,4,8,vBhEojOdcPqkQbFWXJFJeQ

Where's Quality Control??? My application has over exceeded dates provided by National Passport Agency. You are holding my son's personal information. 

I see a pattern with people who had to resubmit documents having to wait half a year-year, how is this type of productivity acceptable?

For starters, I drove from Atlanta, GA to New Orleans to get a same day passport because I could not wait the estimated time of 12-18 weeks for mine to arrive in the mail. 

I researched ways to get a passport quicker and kept coming across these agencies but I was conflicted because of the mixed reviews but I took a chance and called. Of course I had to wait a while over the phone and call several times before I got through to someone but I was honestly willing to do whatever because of my upcoming trip that was already paid in full that I couldn't miss.

Once I got through to someone I explained my issue and she gave me the necessary information for me to successfully get a passport same day. That information was:
-In order to get an appointment pre-booked you had to have one of two situations. #1 you were in an emergency that caused you to leave the country within 2weeks or you had travel plans within the next 2 weeks.
-The next thing she mentioned was that an agency had to have an opening for your appointment. There is an office in Atlanta but they had no spots until mid October and I needed to ease my mind asap so I opted for the next closest which was New Orleans.
-Lastly, you had to have all the required documents which they send an email to confirm what those are but at the time it's confirmation of international flight booked with the confirmation code, passport photo, completed passport application, birth certificate, ID, and additional $60 fee for expediting the process.

The drive for me was 7hrs. When I got there everything went really quick as far as presenting my documents. I was told It would be ready in a few hours which was about 3-4hrs and then I could come back and pick up my passport book and card. 

In the meantime I rented a bike and rode around the waterfront and the French quarter while I waited. I ate and shopped and then returned to get my passport and drove home. 

I would definitely recommend to someone who's on a 4 week time crunch or sooner and needing a passport but do know you will have to be patient and persistent in order to get what you want! Hope this helps (:",2021-12-03 08:43:47 UTC,5,0,0,1,g1SlvPr2bxRNElrkdsikPg

I returned at 10:30 and picked up the passport! 

The process was quick and painless!

Words of guidance to others who might have been in the same situation as me.  If your flying in from out of town - the closest hotel is the Westin New Orleans attached to the mall. The passport office is literally right outside the door of it! It's also a 5 minute walk to the French quarter.  Also- I would take out a late flight knowing you have to wait until the afternoon for your passport.

I would give the hotel an overall zero stars if not for the staff.
I drove here from Orlando, FL with my son and husband. I was delighted to get to the hotel early and after waiting ONE HOUR to check in I was able to check in. After driving 10 hours, waiting in an hour line was unexpected.
I spent Labor day weekend here and was given a room in ""Delta"" and my goodness Ive seen better Hampton Inns. The air was so bad even after lysol-ing the place that my husband could barely breath. Since we were staying 4 nights I knew we had to do something right away. I did speak to a manager who helped us get into the same room type in a different area and the air wasn't quite as bad but still a very outdated room with damage down to the shower tub.
We spent the next few days battling problems with the parking gates, finding parking and even finding a reasonable line for food. Apparently there was a huge dance competition the same weekend which made everything impossible.
On our 2nd night we went to sound waves and inquired about the hours, cost, rules etc. We decided we would save the best for our last full day. We did everything off the property in the first few days and we were so excited to go to sound waves and even hyped my son up about it.
Tonight in anticipation for our big day at soundwaves we went to that area and visited the arcade. I was walking down the hall when my son asked what day tomorrow is. Weird because he is a kid but when I told him he said ""oh soundwaves is closed for the week"" and sure enough in a tiny sign on a tiny easel there was a letter size paper saying that soundwaves would be closed starting tomorrow.
I am so mad I could cry, we sacrificed alot to come here and chose to come here to this hotel and spend the extra money specifically to come here. I called the manager and she said its ""on their website"" which I wouldn't have seen because I booked third party and after speaking to the manager checked it out and it WAS NOT listed on the website (at least not on the mobile version). She waived my parking fee which is nice but after spending $1200+ seems like a drop in the bucket when EVERYTHING revolved around this one perfect water park day.
I would recommend if you are in constant communication with hotel verifying amenities. Also, dont set your expectations too high. This is one of the largest Gaylords and certainly one of the oldest and it shows.

Try to even get a bottle of water its almost impossible. So frustrating staying here. This is even not my opinion we could her many people saying the same things.

My company was there Tues-Fri for a conference, I paid fir 7 rooms for my team.  1 room had barely been cleaned, with trash still in the room & pubes on toilet.  1st nite our 2000 person conference had a welcome party at Falls Bar.  2 bartenders. The bar manager stood around doing nothing, while lines stacked up.  After waiting 45 minutes for a drink with no progress we, like hundreds of others, left.  The rest of the bars/restaurants were either closed or closed early (at 10ish) leaving everyone to go off site to extend any client entertainment.  You can only blame Covid for so long-pay damn bartenders $100/hr and you still make money (a lot!). During the day, you basically had the pizza restaurant (decent and guy from Egypt forget name was nice & wonderful), the convenience store (long lines) or the Cascade restaurant buffet, WAY overpriced & mediocre at best.  The Steakhouse was the only fining highlight--good value on wine list-but when you pay $1200 (8 of us) it better be good.  At $100/nt it would be average-at $200+ simply unacceptable (and over $10k for my team). I called the Spa on Tues to ask if they had a steam room and they said yes, but failed to tell me it was 'Closed due to Covid' WTF! And only open 9am-430p (during our conference???) so no way to steam anyway when I wanted to at 7a or 5p.  Upon arrival we were talking about coming back for our Spring conference-by end of week we decided Motel 6 would be a better option in Nashville.  Again, tired of the 'Covid Excuse'.

The compound is HUGE!  Have your walking shoes ready, chile!  It's its own little metropolis, all under a sky dome.  Lush gardens all over the place, beautiful fountains, boat rides, restaurants... You could literally spend a solid week here without ever leaving the compound.  (Practically next door, you have the Grand Ole Opry, a large outlet mall, as well as Paula Deen's restaurant.) It's a beautiful place to stay!  These were the ""hits""... now for the ""misses""...

My bed was like sleeping on a box of rocks.  I had the WORST 1st night of sleep.  It's a Marriott property and I usually don't stay at Marriott hotels.  I prefer the Westin or Hilton.  This visit is most likely the last time I'll stay at a Marriott.  For the room rate, the beds should be higher quality.  The college dorm refrigerator that we all know and love in hotel rooms... Well, it was hidden in cabinet which gave the fridge little-to-no ventilation.  The fridge, although set to the coldest setting, was as hot as cast iron skillet.  I had to keep the cabinet open my whole stay in order for the fridge to operate like it needed to do.  The fridge was also unbalanced and rocked every time I tried to open it up.

As someone else mentioned, there was no real coffee service.  The machine was hidden, but no supplies.  There were no hotel info guide books, either.  The place is incredibly vast.  I am certain that I didn't stumble across half the amenities that the hotel has.  There was no menu for room service, either.  I think they want you to pull it up on your phone.  Hey, I'm on vacay and want to unplug!! The bathroom didn't have a nice stock of essentials.  I am used to that and would expect it at a ""resort.""  The view...  Well, my view overlooked the parking lot, but in order to see the parking lot, I had to look through cob webs with spider eggs and caked-on dirt, grime.  It was gross!  Did I wake up at a Motel 6 or what??  Speaking of waking up... during my visit, only one restaurant was serving sit-down breakfast.  Unfortunately, I got down there too late as the wait time would have put me at the conclusion of breakfast. With so many people at the resort for a holiday weekend, it would have been nice for them to have offered a late breakfast. The restaurant seated maybe 100, but there were like thousands of hotel guests!  I, instead, ended up at Cracker Barrel across the street.  That was an hour long wait, but at least I got breakfast.

Overall, I'd say check it out.  It really is a very beautiful place!  Parking is pricey at $32 a day and the room rates are steep.  Just don't expect full-out luxury (or breakfast) and you won't be disappointed!",2021-07-10 23:56:38 UTC,3,0,0,0,PliZgq3hutp1Q3oeqdhbEg

We visited in mid November and they had the Christmas decor and lights up in the courtyards and it was gorgeous! So cool to walk around and just take in all the gorgeous plants and water features too.

We had tickets to go the the Grand Ole Opry and this was perfect as far as its proximity to the venue. The hotel has a free shuttle that will transport you to and from the Opry, which is wonderful.

Registration personnel were very friendly and overly courteous. Our room was extremely far walk. Other children were crying from walking too far before we even arrived to our room. There's really no running back to the car if you forget something because it's a serious 20 minutes to go back. Room was small but seemed clean. Bed was very very firm. We decided to go see the water fountain and light show. Realized once we were there that there is no handicapped access to get to lower level seating by the fountain for the show. My 5 year old in a wheelchair had to watch the water show from between railing bars on the side of a cafe balcony. That was very disappointing. The boat ride was an extra $45 so we passed on that option. Halloween kids activities were all extra fees. Totally not worth $500 per night.

The hospitality and service, however, are certainly lacking. Understandably with COVID protocols in place, typical service was not in place and everything had to be requested. This wouldn't be a problem if a call to the front desk (any one of five placed) didn't result in a ten (10) minute hold awaiting personnel to answer each time (I've gotten better response from the local Social Security Office). Upon arrival, the room only had two coffee cups, so I called and requested coffee ""service"". They delivered coffee alone (no cups or cream and sugar), which resulted in having to call again (and wait ten (10) minutes).

Additionally, regarding the shops, they were clean and well run. However, we wanted cheese cake one evening and approached the only shop that sold cheesecake. They closed at 8:00 pm and we approached at 7:58 pm. We were  turned away; granted there was a short line, but I would think they would honor the customer who arrived before closing. No such luck.

Upon departure, my wife noticed a denim jacket in the drive at the entrance of the hotel. She also observed that several employees also noticed the jacket (which was drenched due to the rain), however, no one bothered to pick it up after multiple employees stepped over or around the jacket. Not only did this ""look bad"" to have a dropped jacket just sit on the ground outside such a facility, but also seemed to lack a little respect for the visitor to whom it belonged and who apparently will not receive it back in very good shape if at all.

Finally, I shared all this with the Gaylord through their survey and received a rather lukewarm ""thank you""  email from management indicating that they ""would try to do better"".

Also, be prepared for for additional resort fees ($20/day) and parking fees ($32/day).

Otherwise, we DID have a great time in Nashville touring the Country Music Hall of Fame and catching a show at the Grand Ole Opry!",2021-03-05 11:17:53 UTC,2,0,0,1,keupARBOCSD0Z_K5mWxExw

Very few restaurants and bars are open daily and the menu options aren't great.  For the price of the rooms you would expect multiple restaurant and bar options to choose from but nope.  Room service is either pre packaged items like sandwiches and salads (gross) or order from the limited restaurants. Your only breakfast option is a $24.99 per person buffet that has very limited selections and stale waffles. No alcohol included.  Way overpriced for a breakfast similar to the one we received at the best western we stayed at previously....and that one was free.  If you want access to the cool pool with water slides prepare to pay $50 per person more.  Their regular pool is nice with a DJ so if you do decide to actually stay here just save money and go there but get there early because there are not a lot of umbrellas per chairs.  When we couldn't find anywhere acceptable for dinner (two whopping restaurants were open for Sunday evening: a sports bar and a very expensive dinner buffet) we tried to take the shuttle to the mall but it was broken down and the replacement didn't arrive before it got too hot to sit outside and wait for it any longer.  Valet includes daily so we ended up driving to maggianos away from the resort to get a decent dinner.  One day we opted for a pizza place with a rude cashier and paid a whopping $22 for two slices of pizza and a side salad.  The cashier also did not tell us that we were charged for a combo that Included a drink and neglected to give us the cup or let us know about it until we checked our receipt and inquired.  When my husband went back to ask she was reluctant to give him a cup for the drink we apparently paid for. Keep in mind this is cafeteria style not restaurant quality, pre packaged salad and dressing.  My advice: until they can open their restaurants at full capacity and have more options, don't bother spending the cash to stay here, just park at the mall and visit it and then leave for somewhere cheaper with better options.

I didn't even care she called him fat. I'm 30 minutes in to the search and I'm all alone. No one will help. I was crying and said to her, I'm begging you. Please show me where you saw him last. She refused

I'm in shock and helpless. I began screaming his name. Sobbing. Begging for help and getting nothing except for other guests that immediately took off to help. I'm still begging staff for help and getting nothing. One kind staff member hugged me just as I'm about to pass out. 35 minutes in and I'm begging them to call the front desk from one of the rooms they were cleaning. Nothing. The kind woman that hugged me called her boss for guidance and she hung up on her. She called back and handed her phone to me and I heard the woman say, I can't help her and hung up again. Again I'm screaming why won't anyone help me. Please help me. Nothing. One other cleaning staff took off like a tornado looking for him. Bless her. 

45 minutes into a situation where a non verbal autistic child is missing I heard some guests yelling they found him. Finally then do I see a security guard. Just one though. I'm broken at this point. I thanked the security guard and the kind women that helped. I asked the security guard to walk me to my room as I had gotten myself lost. He did. He was very kind

I decided bro take my son swimming and put this behind me. I made it to the lobby and broke down in tears because it's difficult to go from strong emotions to fully recovered that quickly. Kendall, some sort of manager asked what was wrong. I was shocked she hadn't heard. I told her the story and I'm not angry, I'm in shock. She instantly became aggressive and blamed me. I had already accepted my share of the blame and guilt. She completely disregarded my son. She refused to believe the lack of help was unintentional and assumed I was a racist. I did tell her she was handling this poorly and should be considering the optics of it. I just gave up and left her office after I was refused to be given her bosses contact info. If she was doing her job right why was she afraid to give it out. I did get his first name and I will find him and will discuss the incident with him

Why doesn't this massive hotel geared toward families have protocol for something like this in place? Why are they immediately hostile when I didn't ask to speak to her. She saw me break down and asked me what's wrong. I am completely disgusted that a $500 a night hotel has so little regard to guest safety. That should be bare minimum. I won't go back and I definitely do not suggest this hotel for families with special needs children. They treat them worse than animals.",2021-09-07 07:55:37 UTC,1,0,0,0,hc58JW_Mah_9qMo6ntuI-Q

This time was different. 

The gardens are beautiful. The balcony view is beautiful. 

1. The room was not vacuumed, nor was the balcony. Some kids must have had cookies with glitter because there were crumbs 

2. It has never been so intensely crowded at the hotel. I love this place, I am serious...it was crowded. There are kids everywhere and people don't watch them well. It is probably the addition of the water park. We headed to The Fuse sports and it was so understaffed that even though they had 50+tables they were only seating at 15-20. It had nothing to do with social distancing because people were packed around the bar and standing. They just had no wait staff for tables. The wait for the Jack Daniels restaurant was one hour. We were starving. We tried to just get a drink and go out to the Lobby where the band was playing, kids were running around and loud while band was playing near Fuse. I have kids. I love kids. Some kids are not well behaved, have staff ask them to be seated to be respectful of other paying guests. 

3. Nashville was so packed it was an up charge time for Lyft and Uber and to travel 3 miles to a restaurant was $98 for the base Uber. We made the decision to walk over to Mission Barbecue because it was .6 miles. Normally ok, but it was 93 degrees. This meant we all got ready to ""go out"" and we were now going to be soaking wet with sweat.  There are only sidewalks part of the way from the hotel to the mall area (it looks close but you are playing chicken in mall parking lots and have to cross through grand old opry lot and there was a concert so it was like a game of Frogger).
We wanted to go to Basement East or downtown...anywhere where we could get a drink and listen to music since hotel had no tables and no wait staff. Uber downtown was $150. 

We messed up. We should have brought a cooler with food and drinks. Planned only to stay at hotel and got a table like an early bird at 4 pm for dinner perhaps?

I know the tourism industry is just restarting, but this was a big eye opener for me about how to prepare for travel I have planned in July. We are all used to being able to grab a cab or Uber or eat out. I will now pack food and drinks and assume unless I want to drop $300 on Uber to have a plan B or stay closer to where I want to go out or listen to music. 

4. Had noticed floor wet a few times yesterday and though it was from all of us washing hands. Nope. Toilet leaking. 

5. Went to make coffee, no sugar or sweetener. 

I will come again someday I am sure. It is a beautiful place. I hope they get additional staffing for restaurants, and some additional cleaning staff for rooms.",2021-06-27 13:22:04 UTC,3,1,1,4,yMDiU9PYIo_i_aP7jO-g0Q

This place absolutely stunning. It is on point with some of the best Vegas hotels as far as cleanliness, visual appeal, size, and facilities. The hotel is divided into multiple sections, each with rooms, restaurants, pools, and even shopping. Great for large families/ young kids and special events. Both the Garden Conservatory and Delta Atrium are perfect for photo opportunities. 
Our family of 6 were wandering the first day and actually lost our bearings and got lost. This place is HUGE! The Soundwaves indoor/outdoor waterpark is probably the cleanest and well rounded hotel/waterpark we have ever been too. Keep in mind it was only built two years ago, it seems very well maintained.
Now here are the downsides...and there are many.
The place is expensive, like really expensive. If you look at the base prices for the rooms, it appears relatively standard. A two queen room can run you under $300 depending on your view (interior or exterior). But then you have to add in an unexpected $20 daily ""resort fee"", and $32 daily parking. Then on top of that, the Soundwaves package to enter the waterpark is when the room price gets kind of ridiculous. I can somewhat understand what they are doing. The waterpark is exclusive for hotel guests so it never feels overwhelmingly crowded. Our family stayed 4 nights. The first night, we used the free pools and we all had a Blast. But once the kids see the waterpark, the free pools look like a puddle and FOMO takes over.
Also, everything in the hotel is crazy expensive. Example; we forgot two toothbrushes and one toothbrush at the market cost $9. 
The first night, we ate dinner at the Cascades buffet for a family of 6 and the bill came out to $160 (without any alcohol)! Go out and get yourselves some groceries. Order a pizza (Papa John delivered) for dinner and eat in your room. 
One other thing to note...it is definitely understaffed. At least it feels understaffed. To get a proper cup of coffee, I had to walk from the Cascades section to the Delta section of the hotel. Back and forth is easily a 1/4 mile. Many places are closed during weekdays.
All in all...the Gaylord is visually stunning, clean, and there is plenty to keep your kids entertained. Your family will remember this place for a lifetime. Parents/Grandparents...just be prepared to pay for those memories.",2021-07-18 14:50:44 UTC,4,0,0,1,m3YQXbkQgsSVs4_M8hrGfQ

I think it was excellent customer service to reach out to me so quickly in order to take care of an unsatisfied guest. I will be staying again and giving them a chance to give me a better experience! I will say that I was a little disgruntled when I made my review but to take a step back and focus on the positive things: they have so many fun activities and shows going on that the whole family can enjoy, the scenery, plants and lights are absolutely beautiful, the Delta boat ride is fun and cute during Easter as you can find eggs throughout, the front desk staff and all the rest of the staff are friendly, and the hot tub was fantastic as well. I look forward to staying again and I have faith that my next experience will be better! Thank you, Tim! 

I've always loved Opryland Resort, it's absolutely gorgeous, has fantastic restaurants and many fun things to do for the whole family. With that being said, my stay was subpar, for several reasons. For the astronomical price that they're charging (seriously, I could go to Disney World's Animal Kingdom Resort and have giraffes out my freaking window for that price) the experience should not be this subpar. The rooms are just decent, the indoor pool is freezing, the room service food is comparable to gas station food, and they up charge every single thing that they possibly can. 

I am a member (which ultimately I know doesn't mean much unless I'm top tier but, still) and I mentioned it was my birthday on our reservation notes and no one acknowledged it or left any kind of amenity for us in the room or anything. I'm not expecting a red carpet rollout but I've worked at several hotels from boutiques to five star resorts and at every single one management always instructed us to leave a ""birthday"" amenity. Again, for what I'm paying I expect some kind of amenity. I stayed Friday night and made a last minute decision to stay Saturday night as well and when I went to book the room they told me I couldn't get my member discount because I wasn't booking online. Seriously? I can't get my member discount booking directly at the hotel? That's simply stupid. Our toilet spontaneously overflowed Friday night and spilled out into our room and there was no apology or offer of a discount. They also double charged me for parking. I adore the scenery but unless they match the prices by taking better care of their guests or lower their prices to match their mediocrity then I probably won't be back for awhile.",2021-03-14 19:48:26 UTC,5,0,0,0,3lSFMa7KABiYMrWv_ciKSQ

We ended up spending about 7 hours here!! First we walked through all the gardens, and then we bought little things of wine and mixed cocktails and drank them while we watching the water show. We got swept up in how peaceful it was and just kept talking and slowly enjoying our drinks. We got drinks at the Cascades Lounge and the server was really nice and friendly. I tried the blackberry lemon fizz drink and the waitress said she could add a lot less blackberry to make it less sweet and it was perfect! Be mindful it was pretty loud sitting by the waterfall and there was a musician performing. However, the musician was really good!!! She had a lovely voice, and it was a nice little experience. Finally, we went to Delta to have a slice of pizza and watch the night water show. We ended up sitting and watching a children's pirate show that had singing and dancing and fire eating?!?!? It was surprising but really nicely done, and we ended up just watching the show as we had dinner. Here is a tip, we realized it would have been cheaper to just get a bottle of wine ($20) and a whole pie ($20) then the 4 glasses of wine plus other cocktails and 6 individual slices ($26). The pizza was really really good too and was nice and cheesy .

That is a lot of money to pay for parking mom whether it's once or a few timesThe 1 star I've given my review is for the grounds & atmosphere. Beautiful!!!!

My husband & son were at the hotel for a business conference. My younger daughter & I tagged along so we could visit my older daughter that lives in Nashville. 
The stay/experience was ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!!!
I would like to say upfront that I AM NOT a person who complains. I don't even send food back if it's not right so this is a big deal for me to write this review. 
First, we did not get the type of room we had booked. My husband booked an atrium view room with 2 queen beds & a pullout couch. Instead we were given a room with 2 queen beds and at the back of a hallway. It was not large enough to get a rollaway bed, so my 27 yr old son & 7 yr old daughter had to share a bed. 
The women I spoke to at the front desk regarding this issue gave me a few ways to remedy THEIR mistake....she would do her best to get us a room that we'd originally booked, we could pay for a rollaway bed (which again wouldn't have fit in our room, or we could pay just under $250 for a 'suite-like' room. I told her 'Thanks' and that I'd be right back to let her know what we wanted to do. I went back down about 10 minutes later to let her know what we had decided on & when I started to tell her she told me that she was sorry but they were 100% booked. She apologized & offered to give us rollaway bed for an ADDITIONAL CHARGE. AGAIN, I told her that our room was not big enough for a rollaway. 
Second, SELF PARKING is $32 a day so every time my daughter would come to visit us at the hotel she would have to pay $32. My daughter is young and trying desperately to live on her own. That is a lot of money to pay for parking whether it's once or a few you times. We ended up giving her our credit card so she could pay every time she came.
Third, maid service was pretty NON-EXISTENT. We were told that because of sanitary reasons the maids would not be coming into our rooms. We would have to ask for towels every day, they would not come in to make the beds or change the sheets. They had the shampoo, conditioner and body wash in dispensers in the shower. I called down to tell them that we needed another conditioner and body wash. When we came back to the room later that day the dispensers were in a bag hanging on our door knob. The dispensers were supposed to be in bottle holders in the shower. We were unable to open them to put the replacement bottles in so they sat on the edge of the bathtub. 
I asked if they could bring us towels and empty the garbage. They did neither. I emptied the garbage into one bag and put it outside our door. I then called down a second time for towels. They brought some up. They never took the used towels away & stayed here for seven days. Every day I had to call down and ask for towels. After seven days and four people I'm sure you could imagine how many towels were in the bathroom. At one point I had to call and ask for Kleenex and toilet paper. 
The stay here was a horrible experience.
 I understand that we are just starting to get to a some sort of normalcy to our lives. And for some places it is a tad difficult. But this is a resort that we paid A LOT of money to stay at. If you booked your self to full capacity but do not have enough people to work then you should have planned accordingly. 
I am a stay at home mom, and after a year of helping my seven year old with online schooling I was looking forward to a nice relaxing vacation. I was so very disappointed.",2021-06-07 23:22:33 UTC,1,0,0,0,dc03pRqFC_zVgu-39eHdpw

It was absolutely amazing to walk through each atrium and see the live plants and holiday decorations.  The hotel is well worth coming to walk through at night even if you're not planning on staying. 

With that being said, I was really torn about giving this place two or three stars.  The amazing the indoor plant life, the water, and the decorations were truly amazing, but I am rating a hotel stay opposed to an event or attraction. 

The hotel does a great job of creating a little city, but the amount of guests really seemed to overwhelm their recourses.   Dinner wait times for a restaurants were over one hour and forty five minutes, and we were told that the breakfast restaurant was over committed and could not take any more tables. We considered driving out for dinner , but parking was such a pain due to an overbooked valet. 

I probably will not stay here again. I would come back and tour the hotel when it's decorated.",2021-11-14 17:12:41 UTC,2,0,0,2,rXnO0wXAkOu0SdXGUJaw2w

Food: we ordered the room service on the app because we were so exhausted. The food arrived fast and hot!  We had pizza, fries and a chicken sandwich. It was the best sandwich I have ever had. The fries were so good and hot. The were seasoned with cracked black pepper and course salt. They tasted like they were prepared in our room.

Still beautiful, however...  
I understand that things are difficult with Covid. Upon booking I specifically asked if everything was open in the hotel. I was told yes all restaurants are open. That was a lie. Very few restaurants are open and of course the seating is very limited, understandably with a pandemic . Only one restaurant takes reservations. The problem is it is spring break and Marriott absolutely packed this hotel. They are filling every room as the person at check-in told us. How do you fill a hotel with this many  rooms and not have restaurants open?  You can open a restaurant and still have seating spaced. But I walked by at least five of their major restaurants last night and they were dark. A coffee shop closes at 11o'clock in the morning. My son-in-law attempted to get some fruit and a muffin for the kids and they were sold out at 8:45 AM. They do not even provide you with bottled water in the room! And you get two paper cups. Heaven for bid you need to use one to brush your teeth!  This is absurd. If you are going to pack a resort then you should have enough food and facilities to feed the people staying here.  There is no maid service, which I completely understand again due to Covid. Every single thing we need we have to call for including toilet paper. I don't care if you don't want people coming in and out of the rooms. Hang a bag of toilet tissue, Kleenex and extra towels on the door daily then. And now there's a flooding situation around Nashville so of course it's very difficult to go anywhere else to eat.  This is the first time we have gone anywhere in over a year and a half as with many other people.  So disappointing. Sure hope we can find some food somewhere. Not even coffee available this morning!!",2021-03-28 14:29:57 UTC,2,0,0,0,waqzw2iBj9JWcQsJkaP3LQ

The venue had so many people it was hard to walk it was so congested. If you wanted to find beer, water, or better yet food GOOD LUCK! Half the restaurants were closed. Some of the restaurants were first come first serve and had LONG lines ( hour plus waits) if they would even accept more people SERIOUSLY ! We were turned away from places to eat on site because they were full or we didn't have reservations. With a venue this big there should be a place to get a burger or something to eat !

For the price you pay at this resort they FAILED!!  Staff is nice but overworked and I'm assuming underpaid. Marriott do better !

I would have to purchase all my pizza by the piece which of course was much more expensive. They have sit down restaurants, but they were like starting at $40-$50 per person so with a large family that was prohibitive. I booked this hotel through Expedia. I was quoted $1,010.80 for two nights. When I actually got the credit card charge from the hotel it was $1,121.40. No invoice was given. I've spent 40 minutes  on the phone trying to get in touch with someone. They charge you $32/day to park your car in the parking lot even f you are staying there. It's pretty much  a rip off.

Social distancing with the phone in place but it did not come in the way of having a pet definitely recommended.

It's usually a nice place to stay but this visit has been so disappointing. We stayed here the weekend of Valentine's Day.

Restaurants:
Do not plan on coming to this hotel hungry. Only a few restaurants are open and there is at least an hour and a half wait for all of them.
Extremely overpriced and the signage is wrong on opening/closing times. I contacted customer service to ask for an updated schedule and didn't receive an answer. You are better off eating at the Cracker Barrel across the street. 

Staff:
You can tell their staff is stretched so thin. Everyone was trying so hard to be polite and accommodating, but you could tell there was something really going on to where they were all on edge. I felt really bad for them. The cooks and servers had to come in during the snowstorm and I'm hoping they at least could stay overnight.

Scenery: 
Beautiful! This was the nicest part of our stay. We enjoyed walking around the garden because there wasn't anything else to do.

Rooms:
On our 3rd day, we finally got ahold of room service and were able to have someone clean the room. However, our sheets were not replaced like we requested and there were still stains on them. I get it's a standard practice these days and for safety- but could you not just give us clean sheets to put on ourselves? That would have been totally fine.

I also want to add we were snowed in and no one was really able to leave the hotel due to dangerous conditions. The whole town was closed and there was zero communication from the hotel about if we could extend our stay, what restaurants would be open/closed, etc. and we spent 3 hours trying to find something to eat.

Parking is $32 a day. The reservations for the Soundscapes are usually full, although the man working there let us in so that we could walk around and see what it was like. We did do the boat ride ($14 per person) and that was our 6yo niece's favorite part, but this stay was absolutely not worth the price of $300+ a night. My MIL spent all her Marriott points on it.

We stayed here for one night. We got two rooms which were connected through a lockable door. My outlook on the experience was that it was good, great with friends, but overall just good if I wasn't taking into account that my friends and family were with me. 

I'm not a very picky person, most things I just go with the flow with. However, having said that, there was definitely a few things I can talk about that was negative with the actual hotel rooms. For one, the sheets were awful. I am never picky about sheets but they were stiff and felt like paper. Another issue is the thin walls. We were able to hear conversations down the hall from people in the hallway as if our door was open. At one point I went over and checked because it sounded so crystal clear. My friends who used the shampoo, shower gel, and conditioner that came with the hotel room, said they all felt the same, just dyed different colors. Overall, the room experience isn't great. Luckily, you're not spending majority of your time there, or at least we weren't.

Now, the views. This place is beautiful. I think everyone who has been here can attest and agree to one thing: this is a beautiful resort. The waterfalls, the roses, the greenery, the hanging and twinkling lights - it's all so very beautiful. 

As far as options to eat in the resort, we went to a pizzeria place I can't quite remember the name of, but it was pretty good! We also had Carvel and Auntie Ann's for dessert and that all tasted splendid. For breakfast we ate at Auntie Ann's and Cinnabon. The lines were pretty bad but nothing like the marketplace line. They moved relatively fast, though, and the food was hot.

We spent majority of our time at the waterpark, which is huge and tons of fun. The rides are a-plenty and we swam for hours on end! Only complaint here is the lockers are, you guessed it, way too overpriced. The smallest locker, a ""medium"" is 12 dollars, and they don't accept coins. You're best just hiding your stuff like we did.

In summary, though, I believe this place is way too overpriced. I feel bad about how much my parents paid - don't get me wrong, I had a wonderful time because I always will when I'm with friends and family, but if I had come here alone I would have been immensely dissatisfied.",2021-08-08 15:41:24 UTC,3,0,0,1,1zCvERvAPIULUQV2ZVn3CA

Bad things: No balcony/terrace in suite. Someone's hair left in the drain of my very expensive room. Someone's toenail left on the floor of my very expensive room. No housekeeping during your stay. Very long wait to valet. At least a half hour plus. And if you want to self park you still have to pay almost as much as valet. Long lines at check in. During the week most restaurants and stores closed resulting in extremely long lines for morning coffee and or breakfast and extensive hour plus waits for dinner. Specifically asked multiple times prior to vacation and at check in if all restaurants are now open and was repeatedly told yes! Huge lie! Not even close. One of the pools closed even at end of week resulting in crowded conditions at other pool. No towels to be had at pool at Noon.  All gone! Very long walk to room and most people are lost in the maze of very long hallways, sections with almost no helpful staff available to guide you. Very expensive food and drinks in the restaurants. Dessert at Carvel was 18 dollars for 2 cups of ice cream with topping. 18 dollars for 2 cups of ice cream is ridiculous.  Extremely long hold times anytime you call the front desk.  Staff in stores and restaurants seem stressed and overworked because they are! Hire some more people or lower your occupancy rate.  Tons of kids who are under the age of 12 so can't be vaccinated yet have no mask. 99 percent of kids and adults here not masked. Very crowded!",2021-07-08 20:05:17 UTC,2,0,0,0,eeTTUj2GFluC4RJbQyXCGg

Bless her little heart. Gosh, we thoroughly enjoyed our time at Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center (we stayed in room C4134 which has an interior view of the atrium in the Cascades Wing -- it's AWESOME). This is definitely a one-of-a-kind resort experience, and the place is quite simply astronomical in size -- 750,000 ft.² of meeting space, 2,712 guest rooms, and 176 spectacular suites. It's a quick Uber to downtown Nashville, and a (balmy) 10 minute walk to the Grand Ole Opry and Ryman Auditorium. The resort features a waterpark, tons of restaurants, spa and fitness center, indoor gardens, cascading waterfalls, and an indoor river with a Delta floatboat. They even have an arcade room, which is super fun when you're the only two people there. Katie liked all the shopping venues; I enjoyed the Fuse Sports Bar and Jack Daniel's. While all the wedding stuff and downtown Nashville kept us busy (sorry we missed you, Nissan Stadium), we could've stayed just at the resort for an entire week, exploring around as though it were Disneyland. A special shout out to Olivia at the front desk. She was so joyful, so engaging, so funny. Whomever hired her knows amazing talent when they see it. The woman deserves a huge raise AND a trip to Barbados for two. I'm serious. Reward Olivia or my company will steal her.

Let me start by saying this company needs to shut this location down until they have staff. It is not the staffs fault (I know because they tell you), but a company who wants to make money over employees and provide some of the worst customer experience I have ever had.  The staff is doing everything they can, and it is clear the company is not supporting them. Very clear. 
I am here for a work conference and the rooms were over $250 a night. I have heard so much about it, and was so excited to visit. When I went to check in, my coworkers business card was on the room, and her flight was delayed so I could not check in. No problem, I thought I would go sit and have lunch and get work done. I went into the sports bar and the service was aggressive and just plain rude.  The salad was not fresh and the wings tasted microwaved. For a side salad, 6 barely edible wings, and a beer I paid over 50 dollars. You can see the look of people being overworked and under appreciated. The prices are wayyy to pricey for the quality. The bartender also had an attitude with customers that actually made it awkward to ask for anything. AND, no internet. Apparently, you cannot get internet anywhere in the hotel until you pay for it when you check in. The only place where you can is the busy check in lobby. They charge for the internet, 30-40 for parking, the water park, etc. No internet!?!?! They could see we had a reservation.
The restaurants are barely open and terrible. I understand with COVID they don't have staffing, but it's interesting the $60 steak place is open, but not casual eateries.  The wait is over an hour for anything that's open. We are now making a joke that you come here hungry, and leave hungry.  We ordered take out and thought we could survive off that. We put it in the room fridge and the next day everything was frozen solid and inedible. Also, there was no microwave in the room or seen so take out is not even an option if you want to eat it hot. We then got bagels from Starbucks today that were literally inedible.  Literally. We went to take a bite and could not get a piece off. But, the way the customer service seems to be, can we even complain? Read the reviews on the restaurants. They charge so much money for everything as well, because they know you do not have options. We asked the bartender at a pop up bar for a glass of water and was told they don't have running water behind the bar. (if you want to fill a water bottle and not pay 3 dollars for a water, go to the fitness center).  Yesterday we could not find a place to eat lunch. All the barely open restaurants were only serving buffets. They ranged from $30-50 a person, and does nothing to acknowledge COVID or food allergies.  The conference had  food trucks for people to eat and even those were an hour wait. Bring food with you. Bring water with you. Not what you would expect for a Gaylord. 
The rooms were deplorable. There were so many hairs on my bed. I had to strip the bed and use a fabric roller to get them off.  We were trying to focus on the conference. Our room was right above the pool so the music literally blasts from open to close. We had work meetings and downtime and couldn't do it in the room because the music was that loud. We also came back to roaches on our bed (see pictures). Our shower head was stuck in a position where water got all over the floor, and without room service, we were left without towels. I asked a room service person for them, they said they would bring them, and I never saw them again. People started putting glass cups out in the hallway and i have now seen a chewed up pretzel in a glass cup in the hallway for three days. 
Horrible, Horrible, Horrible. This was my first, and very last Gaylord experience.  I have had better stays at the Motel 6.
Update:The front desk moved our room and the front desk was kind. We were told they would give us an upgrade since they couldn't ""spray"" our room, but found out we were moved to a room that other coworkers got for the same price. We had to pack everything up and move while the conference was happening and the new room had hair in the sheets and sink as well. This is not the employees fault. It is a organization choosing to charge hundreds of dollars to people recovering from an economic crisis, knowing they have no other options.  I will be reaching out to corporate to demand an explanation. Do not stay here.",2021-08-03 17:28:38 UTC,1,2,0,8,rq7Wcg6GvZqy5FNizvoRjQ

The place is amazing. So nice I had recently visited here for both Fall break and the week after Christmas right up to New Years. The price while high and it gets even higher once you factor in resort fees and parking would be my only challenge in reviewing it. The place is outstanding otherwise. Incredible and possibly the xth wonder of the world. If you haven't stopped in to see this place you should. If you are lucky enough to be able to stay here do so at least once. I did discover staying across the street at the Inn for part of my second stay to save money. The rooms are very nice and a good size. Two very comfortable queen beds. Some rooms have a balcony overlooking the inside atrium of the hotel as well. The pools one indoor and one outdoor are also very large but as the property is huge expect a long walk to the pool. Note this hotel is so large it is really like three hotels in one place so there may be an outdoor pool by the Magnolia wing and I think there is but i havent stayed on that side. Also very convenient is the sheer amount of food and drinks all in one place. This was extremely convenient on New Years eve. I could walk to dinner and eat. Then go back out to the bars to get drinks at my leisure. No driving parking and that kind of hassel. You are also within walking distance of the mall so you can easily walk over to the mall as well to eat at its many restaurants. Again no maid service during the virus so I just called the number to request any refills of items I needed.
The only drawbacks on this property are the astronomical parking costs $32 per day and you add to that the large resort fee of $20 and your out $52 each day before you even get going. Luckily the rates right now are as low as I have seen due to the complete halt of most business travel. I stayed at $169 on some days. Obviously they will vary the rate per days of week and time of year so New Years Eve was higher. There is an onsite water park as well called sound waves. I went the first trip and it is pretty nice, but it also is rather expensive. I want to think I paid around $230 for four people for the whole time I was staying there. It is not well represented the costs and also that the pass if you are a guest covers your length of stay.",2021-01-22 14:49:55 UTC,5,2,0,4,5wFZHdK-WmST2uUBgA4isw

A friend had told me to visit if I was in Nashville, so I took her advice and wow! There's so much inside to marvel at. You can just walk in, no admission, you don't even need to have a room that you're staying in there. In that way it really reminded me of Las Vegas. There is a parking fee, unless you do like we did and park at the nearby mall and walk over, LOL.

There are four sections to explore-- three of them have the indoor outdoors vibe. The air feels fresh like you're outside but is cooler (at least in summer!), and there are many plants, trees, and shrubs throughout, along with water fixtures like waterfalls, moats, and fountains. We went on a Tuesday so it wasn't super crazy busy but there were a lot of events going on in the convention halls throughout. There's also a place where you can get married there.

Tons of shopping and restaurants throughout, so there's plenty of opportunities to spend your money if you choose. We were simply sight-seeing and left with nothing but photos.",2021-08-22 23:28:23 UTC,5,1,1,2,ScHZKzCWISocAxfe7AMKhA

I so wished I had stayed here on this trip after seeing it and it was  only a few more miles from my family but I want to come back soon. 

This pet-free and smoke-free hotel has much to do with 19 restaurants and bars, bicycle rental, game area and fun boat tour. It is visually stunning with 9 acres of indoor gardens, an enormous atrium filled with gorgeous waterfalls, phenomenal landscaping, beautiful foliage, statues and fountains with room balconies overlooking the atrium. Amenities, if you're a hotel guest, include an exercise room, a spa, as well as an indoor pool and 2 outdoor pools. There's also an 18-hole golf course and over 750,000 sq ft of event space, including 6 ballrooms. So much to keep adults and families busy for several days without leaving the hotel.

The seven of us had lunch at my little 5-year old's favorite restaurant, Chuy's, and then we began exploring the hotel. Many selfie locations, opportunities to rest by the fountains and waterfalls, a boat ride and lots of spots to stop for a beverage, snack, beer, wine or cocktail.

I stayed here for 4 nights for a trip with my family and will never be doing so again. When departing, my boyfriend and I walked out of room to a terrified maid. She was shaking and screaming and crying as people congregated out in the hall- we could hear some banging around and screaming in one of the rooms as everyone came out of their rooms to see what was going on. Security was called as we heard screaming and cries of ""help me"" and also ""please let me go, I won't say anything about what happened."" It honestly sounded like a murder scene inside of the room- it was a child screaming. We called 911 instantly and got recordings of the things being screamed. Security got lost and took TEN MINUTES to arrive as the screams and banging continued in the room. When they arrived, they knocked on the door of the room and were told by the occupant that everything was ok in the room. Security kicked them out of the hotel. We asked the security guard when the police would arrive and he informed us that they wouldn't be coming and that they had it taken care of. We played the recordings to them and stated that a child was screaming for help. He brushed us off and told us it would look bad for the property if the police would've showed up, so he called them and cancelled them coming. UNREAL!!! Besides the long walks to anywhere you wanted to go, the dirty room upon arrival, the less than average basic food and overpriced water park,the atrium provided a nice view.

We visited the new Sound Waves indoor water park. It was very nice and not too crowded. It was very hot if you weren't in the water, though. They had 4-5 water slides, 2 lazy rivers, a kiddie play place, and a pool with basketball and a little rock climbing part. My 7 year old had a blast! We also did the snow tubing. We have been snow tubing in Gatlinburg, and it was much better. The tubing here was small and not really worth $20 pp. We did have fun, but didn't stay there long doing it. We ate at a few restaurants as well...Jack Daniels-was pretty good. Large portions, good service. Old Hickory-amazing food! Expensive, but a convenient, upscale restaurant on the premises. We also had the breakfast buffet at Cascades, which is the only real breakfast restaurant to go to. Don't do it! $22/per adult. NOT good. Hard waffles, runny eggs, rubber sausage.

Assumed it was another ICE! Experience with Elf as the theme.  I had not attended any of the ICE! Shows, but wanted to and decided to buy tickets via Groupon. However, It was not ICE! and I should've dug deeper on the Gaylord website to find that info before I bought the non-refundable tickets. It was my birthday and I wanted to do something fun with all our kids- while we are all still together- however our kids are 13-23, and they were quite a bit over the demographic age of Mission: Elf. We took pics and ""played"" the basic child games, but it was hardly worth the $20 plus we paid per person and any ""toys"" they had were glued down so there was a lot of frustrated younger kids who couldn't pick up the toys.  I will say we saw the lady cleaning the screens off quite often so they were doing a great job with cleanliness with the Covid going on. 
We walked through it and it had nice photo ops- but if your kids are over 10 it's basically lame- not really anything super interesting to see and I had wished for ICE! As I had heard good things. (ICE was not available as the sculptors couldn't get to the US from foreign countries due to Covid) All the advertisements make Mission: Elf seem fun- and I assumed it was an ICE! Theme- but it's basic touch screen ""find the messed up toy"" take Elfies with various Christmas decor- make virtual cookies but you never see the cookies.. the dance off and the snowball fight are virtual screens that aren't set to pickup adults or adult sized kids. Basically it was meh and at over $20 a person plus $27 a car to park (and walk a 5k basically to get there!) it took forever to find where Mission: Elf was located as the Gaylord had hard to find signage both outside and inside and it was hard to find anyone to ask. There were several other people just wandering around lost.  We did not plan on eating there, but the lines were huge for restaurants and the other venues- pretzels, drinks ,souvenirs had pretty long lines also. We did not stay overnight but the hotel was decorated nicely in the areas. 
I looked for reviews for Mission: ELF & found nothing that wasn't from a news source or Gaylord. I just wanted people to know in advance what it was like, and if you have older kids- teens then it's not really worth the money. I'm hoping ICE!

With that in mind, we came here for dinner at Ravello. The dinner ambiance was great, but the dinner was lacking quality compared to the cost charged.

Do not book through the Marriott app as the rates will be completely different from what you'll pay at this location which is a huge bummer! So, double check your rates and make sure what they charge you matches your quoted rate. 

The area the hotel is located is not bad. The mini-golf next door was super fun. And, they are close to a lot of restaurants and the highway.

The drain was clogged in the shower and it was 10 p.m. after 10 hours of traveling, and we were completely tired and unpacked for a 3 day stay not a 1 hour stay.  Called attendant but there were no other king bed rooms available.

The attendant came to our room with no mask on. Called maintenance to fix problem and the attendant proceeds to ask us for a knife...really?  I'm quite certain that 95% of occupants travel by air...and do not have a knife.  Can't make that one up. 

Attendant comes up to the room with knife and a series of keys. She lifts drain up and proceeds to take balls of hair and who knows what other things, out of drain with her hands.  Wipes down shower with our towel and proceeds to touch anything and everything in her site without washing her hands, and says ""all good"". Didn't spray down the shower, door handles, door knobs or anything she touched.  We then spent OUR TIME cleaning everything with our travel alcohol wipes, for the next 2 hours until around midnight.  Again, the property wasn't prepared for any emergency in the midst of COVID.

We could hear the maintenance guy say he would be in at 7 a.m. first thing in a.m. to fix, as drain was still clogged. He either knew he would or wouldn't be in, but didn't get to the room until noon the next day, but I'm 100% certain that the property and  maintenance guy put the attendant in a really bad spot.  Why didn't the maintenance guy come out to fix that night is beyond me. 100% the properties fault for not having a contingency plan OR maintainance on demand...OR, they should have called a 24-hour plumber.  Each hotel is a multi-million dollar operation and this hotel was too cheap to have a plumber on call?

Even after the maintenance guy finally fixed it in the a.m. we had to wipe it down AGAIN with alcohol and disinfect it ourselves.  Nobody there thought to clean our room.

After a week of traveling, a no masked attendant in our room, a request for a knife, failed emergency maintenance, unsanitary conditions, (that may have jeopardized our health), travelers that had to wipe down their room twice, and no offer of another king bedroom for rest of trip.

I would not recommend this place for any traveler let alone travelers like myself that stay in a 100+ rooms a year",2021-05-08 22:58:54 UTC,1,0,1,0,JuJYWmi7Q05aapvDBjRtEw

We went on a Tuesday night, so I'm sure that they are usually busier. But on a Tuesday evening, Cigar City Brewing is a fun place to get a meal.

We were seated immediately. There were paper menus for the beers, but you had to scan a QR to get the food menu. Service was pretty good.

I had the Paloma Gose (salted grapefruit sour beer). It was pretty good and complemented most foods. My husband had a lager, and he thought it was fine but not memorable.

We started with the pretzel, croquetas, and chicharrones. Everything was tasty, although I wish the chicharrones were cut a bit smaller (just for ease of eating, although you could cut the chicharrones with a butter knife). 

For my main, I had the pastrami sandwich, and it was a little disappointing. When I read that the meat is piled on, I expect the sandwich to look like a delicatessen sandwich. This looked like a normal sandwich, and it wasn't very memorable other than having too much mustard. The french fries that came on the side were passable. My husband had the burger, and he thought it was great, but again, he was unimpressed by the fries. My son had the kid pizza. It looked pretty generic (although he happily ate it, since he's a kid and it was pizza). My daughter had the chicken tenders, and that was a generous serving, and both kids happily ate them. The kids' meals came out with the appetizers, which was fine since the table was large.

Thank the heavens for Cigar City Brewing; A beacon of craft beer deliciousness in the beer oasis which is West Tampa.

The space is large and the brewery and taproom is nicely decorated.  The bar area surrounds the brewing vats which makes for some cool photo opportunities.

I arrived early on a Friday evening and the outdoor and in door seating was pretty packed.  I got lucky and found a seat at the bar.  As they have a large amount of beers on tap, it took me a while to figure out my order.  The service there is great and I was asked at least three times in five minutes if I was ready to order.  The service was that attentive until closer to 10pm when the servers were much less attentive.

I started with an order of Chicharrones which was a large portion for an appetizer and absolutely delicious.  The portions could easily feed two or three and it was the perfect compliment to a night of beer tasting. 

THE BEERS:

Fancy Paper... Hazy IPA 6.5% ABV... this hazy IPA has the right kind of everything a hazy IPA should have, juicy, citrus, delicious!

White Oak Jai Alai IPA 7.5% ABV... WOW... that white oak transforms this IPA into something MAGICAL.. this is FIRE!!!!!

Space Pope... American IPA 7.3% ABV... this is a decent IPA

The Bendwood... Hazy DIPA 8% ABV... kinda juicy, strong and delicious... this is a Hollywood Star IPA!

Old Blazes... Belgian strong ale 7.9% ABV... Everything you would expect from a Belgian. Delish 

Slap Hitter... Cream Ale 4.7% ABV ... nothing special, not my palate 

Improvisacion... Rye Indian Brown Ale 6.6% ABV... Can't  easily describe this one.  English rye ale, smokey with an IPA finish.  Can't make this Sh@t up... It actually works.  It was very good.

Tam O'Shanter... Strong Scotch Ale 6.4% ABV... this is a well balanced English style ale

I was very impressed by Cigar City's beer offerings.  Other than the Slap Hitter, everything I tried was very good.  I didn't rate the Jai Alai, Florida Cracker, Maduro Brown Ale, Florida Man, or Guayabera because I have had all of these many times over the years. All are consistently fantastic.  

I was surprised not only with quality of the Beer offerings at Cigar City, but also by the consistency and overall balance of all the beers.  I have been to too many breweries where you can tell the brewers are brewing for themselves. The brewers here are brewing for the public and are doing an exceptional job.  KUDOS...

More and more, the city has been making a name for itself with something else. Craft beer.

At the forefront is Tampa Bay's OG craft beer hub, Cigar City Brewing. I've been to their location too many times to count. You see, I'm a bit of a connoisseur myself...and I've been on a roll lately. Recently, I found myself in the area with an hour to kill, so I stopped by their familiar tasting room. I was pleasantly surprised to find a remodel of the tasting room, which now also boasts a full service restaurant. I was even more surprised when they told me that they updated everything over a year ago. COVID be damned, it's been awhile! On that note, I felt totally safe while inside, even though I chose to sit outside.

As a longtime fan of Cigar City's Maduro Brown Ale, I find it to be my usual go to beer. I do, however, enjoy that I can order a flight of similar beers on tap when the urge to expand my taste buds comes about. Honestly, if you can't find a beer that you like here, then you don't like beer!

I'll be back soon, not only for more beer, but to try the food in the new kitchen.",2021-07-08 02:19:08 UTC,5,5,0,2,5OVQLssRcNR71bgSOKNw9Q

My memories of it are a little hazy aside from it being tasty and reasonably priced for the quality. They may not even brew whatever it was I drank then these days. 

Fast forward to today: Cigar City Brewing has now been around for well over a decade and is doing an awesome job of representing many styles of beer!

Almost as important to Floridians, they also represent the under appreciated history and culture of the city of Tampa! Check out the book ""Cigar City Mafia"" if you'd like an insight into Tampa and much of the rest of Florida's past, as it took a lot more than Mickey Mouse and Tony Montana to make it the ""interesting"" place it is today. Oh, and Tampa is a lot more than strip clubs and seediness, really. 

As for the beer, I impulse purchased a sixer of ""Maduro"" from Publix. This is a brown ale coming in at 5.5% ABV and 20 IBU's, brew date was clearly printed on the box: 5/20/21, only about 3 weeks old. 

To try and sound like a beer snob: the pour was dark and the head formed nicely and stuck around. The taste? Reminiscent of well-known New Castle Brown Ale, except a lot fresher and a bit more of an oat taste. This makes sense as the front of the Maduro can reads  ""brewed with flaked oats.""  I used some random glass my parents had in their cabinet that looked like a glass you'd see at a brewery. Not sure what the style is called but it's pictured here. 

I'd love to visit the Cigar City brewery one day if I'm ever back in Tampa, and I wish I could find their products up in NJ. Maybe I can? I've become much less of a beer drinker but could definitely see keeping some Maduro in my fridge on the regular.

My wife and I headed here for a brunch with co-workers. My wife set the whole thing up and after calling around to a few places, Cigar City was the only one that seemed to be looking forward to accommodating the larger group. While they couldn't guarantee anything, the said they would set aside an area and they did. We had the perfect set-up in a semi-secluded area that was more like an open, private room, if that makes sense.

We were supposed to be 20 people but ended up having around 16 people. Our server was great and was around often to check on everyone. She took drink orders and food orders.

Some appetizers floated around and I had two beers. My wife had two beers as well and we both ended up having meals. The beer and the food menu is perfectly fitting for Tampa. Local inspirations, Cuban/Spanish flair, Floridaesque, a place I feel at home.

We both started with the FrostProof beer. A Belgian-style white ale that was smooth and crisp. The orange peel was the stand-out flavor and it packed a 6% ABV so expect to feel it.

The Dirty South flatbread made it's way to our end of the table and subsided our initial buzz. The flatbread was crisp and topped with fresh, tasty, roasted pork shoulder, zingy bbq sauce, onions, bacon and smoked cheddar cheese. A favorite among those at the table.

The hummus also made its way to us. This dish was a cilantro, lime flavored hummus. It tasted freshly made and was the perfect consistency. The pita bread it came with complemented perfectly. It was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside with ample seasoning.

We ordered the Bavarian Beer house pretzel to split. I love pretzels and you can't go wrong with them, mostly. These were hot and fresh. The perfect taste and lightly salted. I enjoyed the Jai Alai beer cheese but the champagne mustard was too sweet for me.

For our second beer choices, I went with the Florida man double IPA and my wife went with the Apple Pie Cider. The Florida man boasts an ABV of 8.5%. It was hoppy and bold but not super bitter which I liked. I could have had another one of these but only after I was already home.

The Apple Pie Cider was amazing. A lot of times, these types of ciders have a hint or essence of the flavor. This cider tasted like I literally ate a piece of Apple Pie. You could taste the apple, the cinnamon, nutmeg and even the golden flakiness of the crust. I don't know how it was possible but it was done. Kudos to Cigar City Cider and Meade, a subsidiary of Cigar City Brewing.

If you've made it this far, I'm almost to the end, hang in there....

We ordered from the handhelds. My wife got the Cubano and I ordered the burger, with cheese, no onions. The Cubano was spot on and decently sized. Fresh ingredients on fresh local bread (La Segunda?), crispy and pressed. It came with a side order of fries. My wife highly enjoyed it and had half to take home.

My burger was also a hit. Perfectly cooked, well seasoned ground beef with fresh, crispy toppings. The soft bun held everything together. The only thing I didn't rave about was the tostones. They were seasoned well but were not crispy like I expected them to be. Tostones are fried plantains, smashed and then fried again. These were chewy, soft and besides the seasoning, didn't have a lot of flavor. Next time, I'd order fries.

I'd go back to Cigar City again. It's a bit of a schlepp for us, coming from Riverview but the food and beer is worth it. The staff is friendly, the vibe is great and they have the notoriety. Cigar City is the only brewery from the area I knew before moving here. Everyone has had a Jai Alai.

I visited on a Friday evening and was lucky to grab the last table outside. They were pretty busy the whole time I was there, but if you're comfortable indoors there was no wait as far as I could tell. Despite being pretty busy our server was super friendly and attentive. 

Their outdoor space is smaller than I would have expected, but their inside was super spacious and had a lot of TVs. For locals I could imagine this being a great environment to catch a game. 

I went for a flight as I usually do at new breweries. Of the 5 I tried the Scottish strong ale with candy cap mushrooms was my favorite and certainly the most unique. Thankfully it didn't actually give off any mushroom flavor, more of a cardamom spice with a little sweetness to it. The other beers I tried were solid but nothing to write home about. I would have loved to try some of their barrel aged beers, but they mostly checked in at over 10% abv so I would've been one and done to be able to drive home. 

I didn't try any of the food, but the menu is mostly typical bar fare with a little bit of local influence. My friends tried the burger and wings and enjoyed them, but if you're visiting from out of town like I am I think you're better served saving your food for elsewhere",2021-04-11 22:50:33 UTC,4,0,0,0,vDtDbMgTSkSrKS_9Bq6TrQ

The first time we came we sat at the bar near the kitchen. The bartender was very short with us and it took him a while to even take our drink order. Which was weird considering there were about 6 bartenders. All just talking in groups to customers. Finally he came by to take our beer order and we basically had to bed him to stay so we could go ahead and order some food. Beer was 7/10 and food was 1/10. We left disappointed as everyone told us to come here. 

Second visit we decided to go and give another try because now we like the Jai Alai we buy from the stores. This visit we were seated on the long booth near the bathrooms and kitchen. We waited and waited and waited some more before anyone took our beer order. All while we're watching about 6-8 employees behind the bar take beer shots and laughing. Not caring that we have been waiting more that 15min to even get service. The table next to us finally got up and went up to the bar and made someone come service us and them. Finally getting our drinks out beers were gone and another 20 minutes go by and we didn't even get to order food. All while food is stacking up in the kitchen window. No food runners I guess. No manager. Just employees running the place into the ground. My husband went up to the bar where there was a bartender apologizing to a drunk women who felt disrespected by another bartender for something he said to her. After my husband waiting for them to finish talking, he paid and we left again. Very disappointed.

Surprise. We decided to go a 3rd time. I know what everyone is thinking....why!!??!? We just moved a few blocks away from here and my husband still likes Jai Alai and with it being very close to us why would not give it another try. 

This time we were sat down in the long booths again. Bunch of employees behind the bar. We see a women in pink running food. This seems like a GREAT improvement from our last visits. Our server came and got our beer order quickly and we ordered a flat bread at the same time. Just in case she went MIA. Lol 

She gets my husband another beer and apologizes to us that the flatbread was taking so long. Something about the pulled pork was taking a while. The flatbread finally came out and there was an OVERLOAD of bbq sauce on this flat bread. Pork had no flavor. Not even seasoning. It was awful. Please put less bbq on this moving forward. There was no way that was the recipe for this dish. 

We decided to order the Grouper with Tostones. We usually just get shareables when we go out so we can try more than just one thing. When our grouper came out fast we were happy. How ever it was a small piece of meat on a little bun. It didn't look like it was made for that bun. Our neighboring table was so interested in the Tostones(smashed plantain) and asked us if we would recommend them once tried. We agreed. So the first Tostones we tried it has no seasoning. But was kind of ok because they serve it with a green sauce to dip in. We split the other pieces up and when we went to go cut into them they were FROZEN!!! The rest of them were frozen. We brought it up to our waitress and she was embarrassed. We just asked for the check so we could leave. She was able to give us the food for free which was nice because we didn't ask for it. 

BUT DAMN! We really tried to like this place. 3 times we tried to like it. We don't want anything for free. But this place isn't anything special. Half the beers are basic. Employees don't care. Food is subpar at best. Cant even serve it hot or make fresh.",2021-05-17 09:22:22 UTC,1,0,0,0,KXtsvenWlY9xry_bZXdwgQ

My husband and I Ubered until our friends could join us. We went for lunch and got a table right away. Only complaint I had with this place was how long it took for our server to show up to the table. He said he didn't know that he had the table, but there were no less than five people surrounding the host station that could have told someone we were waiting. BUT after our server came by to introduce himself, I'd say he was one of my all time favorites. Super knowledgeable about the beer, easily recommended food option (sometimes advising to not go with the most expensive one!), and was very attentive the whole time we were there. Dry humor and someone I would have liked to hang out with more. The food was good - not incredible. I loved the chips that came with the guacamole and the Fritas Queso sandwich (not pictured) was really flavorful and juicy. Big enough to share if you aren't super starving. Everything else was pretty basic. Finally, it was fun to be there for the release part of Paper Plane crafted cocktail. None of us really enjoyed the grapefruit mixed with beer collaboration but still a cool celebration to watch. Check this place out!",2021-08-19 23:53:53 UTC,4,0,0,0,yXwf48QMwRIS-FcP51Ra0Q

My first Cigar City beer was the Hunapu years ago and that was quite an introduction as that was probably the heaviest beer I have ever drank. We walked in around 7:30pm and were seated immediately. There were a good amount of people there, but the place was huge and spread out. Cigar City has a very cool atmosphere in a giant renovated warehouse. 

The food was trying to be kind of fancy very similar to Three Floyd's. The Tampa Chicharrones were not my cup of tea as I hate gristle and fat on meats. The BBQ glaze on them was pretty good though. The Grouper sandwich was solid! The brioche bun was very soft and the fish was fresh with some crunchy lettuce. My friend's steak sandwich was very dry and he said it needed some more sauce. Prices were average and definitely cheaper than Chicago. 

So I don't drink much beer anymore as I found out that hops/brewer's yeast or some beer ingredient messes with my nostrils/sinuses where I get an instantaneous stuffy nose. I figured this out years ago because I drank a Jai Alai at Disney World and I ended up having a really bad stuffy nose and started sneezing quite a bit. So I have found that stouts/porters don't do that as much and I was happy that they had some on tap. I ordered the Boat Parade and The Whole Cigar. Both beers were excellent! The Whole Cigar definitely had a wine flavor, maybe due to the Spanish Cedar. The stouts were similar to Goose Island's BCBS, which I enjoyed.

Overall, Cigar City was awesome to visit and they have some amazing beer! I thought some of the food was good, but nothing spectacular. But it's the beer that's important anyways!",2021-05-16 17:39:56 UTC,4,0,0,0,RNcdWkQe92Jff15Y9X4heg

The beer was fresh and well made. I tried the Boat Parade Imperial Stout with chocolate and vanilla and I found it much too sweet for my taste. My wife ordered the Flag nor fail English pub ale, which I would call a cream ale, and having tasted it I ordered that as my second beer. Smooth and delicious, highly drinkable. 

I wasn't crazy about the food and it seemed hit or miss depending on what you ordered. The buttered soft pretzel appetizer was a big hit. I had the Cuban meatloaf which was a poor choice. It was undercooked and not very good. My wife and daughter were pleased with their Cuban sandwiches, and my daughter's boyfriend enjoyed the grouper sandwich.  Others at the table enjoyed theirs too, so I guess it was just me that made the wrong choice. Oh well, I'll know better next time. 
Also worth mentioning was the service, which was spot on. Granted we ate early and it wasn't crowded when we were seated, but still the service was excellent. 
I did have one small complaint though and that was the seats are what I call designed to turn tables!  Hard on the butt, guaranteeing you don't stay too long.

Just a short drive from TPA, this is the second time I've been to this locally famous brewery.

Since my first visit several years back, Cigar City has remodeled quite a bit. What I remember as sort of a dark, disjointed space has become a modern, brightly lit, spacious beer mecca with table seating and a huge bar. I gotta say, I kinda liked the old version better - the new place is gorgeous but seemed to lack the character of the original Cigar City.  Still, the beer was delish for sure, and the service friendly and fantastic.

I didn't try any food on this visit, but the people around me were ordering some tasty-looking nibbles that certainly enticed me to return for lunch on my next visit to Tampa.",2021-06-01 22:46:25 UTC,4,5,3,6,hxEreDZa2S-RAi1WDhpMWA

Now they knocked down the wall between the two to make one huge room with the bar making a circle around the whole middle area. The whole place is now clean looking and well lit.

The beer is probably pretty familiar to most people from Tampa as Cigar City has been a staple in the area for over a decade. 

When we came here we didn't know that they had added a kitchen to the place so sadly we had already eaten. We did at least try out a pretzel. It was soft and the queso that came with it was delicious. The fiancé didn't like how salty it was.

Had to ask for the water about 10 min after that. Waiting for the apps the waitress said the kitchen was slow tonight. We asked if we could go ahead and put in our main order to get it in line. She came back a couple minutes later to tell us they were out of the steak sandwich (2 of us ordered it). Made other selections. Waited over 45 min for the apps (soft pretzels a bit done).
Main dish finally shows. Plantains were burnt. Meatloaf was dry on one end and rare on the other (meatloaf should not be underdone).  Waitress did check on us while eating, but then slow to come back after we were done. She did not offer any dessert- just asked how we wanted the check (split or one check).

It was very immersive, great displays, and tastings along the way!

It was surprisingly entertaining.

Apparently they require reservations. To our surprise we were not even allowed in the door until I opened their web site on my phone and made a reservation. A reservation was available so after about 10 minutes we were allowed in. Admission - free!

I was familiar with the Sazerac cocktail, but knew nothing of the history or the company. It is a fascinating story of the Sazerac Bar that started the drink and developed into a company that owns several well known brands of whiskys, rums, bitters  and liqueurs.  It is all presented by a fun staff that are well selected for their ability to entertain and educate about drinks and the company. Don't get me wrong, this is definitely a very elaborate advertising venue. But Sazerac has done an excellent job of making it entertaining! There are several stations set up for the docents to educate guest with samples and stories. Also, clever displays show some of the history behind their signature drink the Sazerac and other products. For example, the original Sazerac was made with Absinthe. However, when Absinthe was made illegal they invented Herbsaint which is basically Absinthe without the pesky wormwood. (Absinthe is no longer illegal so it is possible to make the original cocktail again.) 

The building itself is fascinating. Exhibits are on three floors of what was once an old hat and glove factory. When Katrina blew though the city it took the roof off the building. Sazerac carefully renovated the building keeping many of the original features.  One of the docents related a story that on the stairs leading to the third floor that was a hidden switch that was activated when someone treed on the step. Was this perhaps a signal to a hidden speakeasy on the third floor? No one knows. On the first floor they now have a small distillery making Rye Whiskey.

If you are in to New Orleans history and/or cocktails you will not want to miss Sazerac House.",2021-07-25 14:22:22 UTC,5,1,1,2,NnOnjw8He2U6BUNLB9BgGw

MUST SEE for locals & tourists. No matter where you're from, or where you live, you should visit this museum. 

For starters: 
This place is GORGEOUS! If you don't have the 90 minutes to spend on the tour, at least visit the gift shop to look around at the architecture and buy something nice. The gift shop has amazing local finds for everyone, including a vast array of alcohol and mixers. I was very impressed from the selection of hard to find foods, accessories, clothes. If you're not in the mood to shop, check out the architecture. The bottle display holds some interesting finds, and draws the eyes upwards toward the beautiful stairs, ceiling, and loft-style 2nd floor. The designer definitely knew what they were doing. 

The tour: 
At check-in we provided an ID for 21+ bracelets (samples are provided on the tour), and a touch pad key chain (that you have to give back) to enable us to go through the touchscreen exhibits without sharing germs. We were a tour of 6 though we learned we were supposed to be 8. As long as everyone truly does respect the rules of social distance, I'm OK with this group number - but I was happy with 6. Sophia was our guide, and she's extremely knowledgeable and fun. The tour lasts for 90 mins and includes 2 small drink samples, a bitters sample, and a few stops in large display rooms for you to investigate on your own. Being from the area, I still learned things I did not know before going on the tour, and I also really appreciated that the tour was not ""kitschy"" and touristy / overdone. Very enjoyable 2 hours of my life from the time we walked in, toured upstairs, walked the gift shop, and left. 

Downside: 
They have things for purchase - open container drinks is not one of them. They are a museum. They have a gift shop. They do not have a bar or restaurant. Granted, they're surrounded by food and bars in the area they're located in, but still felt like a missed opportunity to me - either that or I was just really thirty for a good drink after that tour. Another odd downside is that this feels kind of like the biggest advertisement ever, though they've done it in a way that I don't mind. They paid for it. They have a distillery onsite. They provide a lot of great information. Go forth - but some of the every day bottles on display still made me giggle because they felt kind of out place on a museum shelf. 

Cleanliness Notes: 
They're very clean. You enter the first door and in the foyer are greeted with hand sanitizer, disposable gloves and masks. The doorman asks if you need assistance, and points you in the correct direction. Moving past the second door you're greeted by a gentleman that takes your temperature and then points you in the direction you need to go. Social distancing is adhered to throughout the building, and every employee was wearing gloves and masks (correctly). They give you a touch pad key chain so that you don't have to touch the screens while walking through the displays. They provide plastic dividers in any area drinks are made. I felt safer there than I have in a lot of places.",2021-02-15 21:48:54 UTC,4,2,1,2,zWOijTIHMgsc5wrbCH5KPA

At first, the tastings seemed meager. But by the end of the tour, we realized they were just right! Definitely pace yourself! 

Each room had a unique experience with instructors who guided and taught us cocktail creations along with history.

If there was a negative it was that the rum was obviously limited to the brands that they sold in-house - which was to be expected but it would have been nice to have had say a Rhum Barancourt but of course I'm nitpicking.

As an infection prevention and control nurse, I was so impressed (and I am not easily impressed as I have very strict standards) with the heightened measures implemented to prevent exposure and transmission of COVID-19. Just wow!! Above and beyond expectations.

The Sazerac House, a new interactive cocktail museum opened its doors in 2019. The historic building, which dates back to the 1860's, is close to the original Sazerac Coffee House. 

This immaculate museum features four different types of bars and virtual bartenders. The real and virtual bartenders showed us how to make signature cocktails and provided recipes. Such a fun experience!! Our tour guide Jim was the best!!

Visitors can tour the museum for free and includes three complimentary samples of New Orleans signature cocktails, of which I found a new favorite, The Sazerac. A must visit when in NOLA.",2021-02-24 02:49:46 UTC,5,2,0,2,ISbc6JFh2kwsEwpBsE30EQ

One of my personal favorite tours we did during our trip to the big Easy was to the Sazerac House.

The sazerac is one of my personal favorite cocktails. Think an old fashioned with a twist! They have been one of my favorite imbibes, and while I kind of knew they were invented in New Orleans, I had no clue there was so much history in each glass. This tour really gave me a better understanding and a deeper appreciation for this delicious cocktail.

While the Sazerac House as it exists in New Orleans today is a new experience, the history dates back to 1850. I don't want to give away too much of the history as the docents throughout the tour speaks so knowledgeably about the history of the drink. 

The biggest thing you'll notice about the Sazerac House is that they spared no expense while creating the tour experience. It all feels incredibly high end. My favorite part was the interactive bar experience. They had video screens with digital bartenders. You are able to select the cocktail you want to learn about, and the digital bartender actually makes the drink for you and gives you the recipe for the cocktail. It's also really fun that the bartender asks you to take a selfie with them. It was a really smart use of technology. 

During the tour you are given samples of a few different drinks. Don't get your hopes up too much because they truly are just samples. My biggest issue with the experience was the fact that you could not purchase a full size cocktail. I would have gladly paid to sit at a bar after the tour and drink. I felt a bit rushed through the tour and pushed out the door at the end.

Our tour guide Ben was amazing and very knowledgeable! He greeted us with his amazing energy at Red Fish Grill! We all met at Red Fish which was the first stop. We walked around for 2.5-3 hrs through New Orleans and tried different staples. You start at Red Fish and end at Tableau Restaurant (there was one more after this one but I can't remember). You try different dishes as well as cocktails. To be honest, the food was just ok to me. I had more fun just walking and talking with the group that came that day. I also enjoyed spending time with my husband, my mom and her friend. It was a nice to-do. I also enjoyed learning about the food history of New Orleans. 

You start at Red Fish tasting Gumbo and a Hurricane 5 cocktail. The gumbo was actually decent. The cocktail was ok. Next, you go to Pepper Palace to try different salsas, bbq sauces and spicy sauces. My husband and I tried the hottest sauce in the store which was the ghost sauce. That sauce was no joke. It had my eyes watering and it burned the back of my throat and lips for about 30 minutes. If you like EXTRA, EXTRA, EXTRA, EXTRA X 10 heat then this sauce is for you! After, you head to Leah's Pralines. To be honest, I don't like pralines or brittle. It taste like nothing but sugar and the texture is way to hard. It got stuck in my teeth. I tried a tiny piece and that was it. It wasn't for me. Then, you go to the Napoleon House for a Pimm's Cup and a Muffuletta. I just took a sip of the Pimm's cup. I was excited to try the Muffuletta because I've heard so much about them but never tried one. It was different and pretty good! I'm not a fan of olives so that makes it a little less tasty for me. However, it's like the sandwich needs the olives to make it what it is. Probably the only sandwich I'd ever eat olives on. We then headed to New Orleans Creole Cookery House for some Red Beans and Rice. To me, these were a little bland and needed more seasoning. I ate them but I've had better. After Red Beans and Rice,  we went to Tableau for a French 75. This drink had a distinct flavor profile. You certainly get that cognac flavor. It wasn't for me but it was different. Lastly, we ended with plantains, pork skins, and daiquiris from well I don't remember. Ooopps! Sorry! The daiquiri was pretty strong. The plantains had a good flavor. They seemed a little over cooked and were a little more mushy. The pork skins were cooked perfectly but they were sweetened. I'm not use to sweetened pork skins. They were different. I certainly like savory pork skins better than sweet pork skins. 

Overall, I enjoyed the tour and it was a good experience. I wish the food would have been a little better but it wasn't bad.",2021-06-02 01:18:54 UTC,5,14,5,16,kmkvsFEwXB58Gq29-Fth0w

My husband and I went there last night in search of a travel trailer. Geoff seemed to be a very nice and honest salesman at first. But as we were looking at thier inventory, I mentioned that I wanted to look at one other place before we made a decision. His demeanor suddenly changed and he started questioning me as to where else I wanted to look and why. I gave him the name of the other dealership and he his response was ""well we own them"". He then proceeded to express the fact that what we are looking for sells fast so we needed to make a decision
The pressure was on. I asked if we could all look at the inventory on line together and he was happy to help. Come to find out, my husband noticed that the search he did was customized to above our budget. Long story short we ended up giving them a HOLDING deposit of $500 and told that we needed to contact him when the financing got approved prior to them prepping it for sale.
We found a better trailer that would meet our family needs much better for a similar price at another dealership. When we called Geoff at Camping World to inform him of our new find, we were absolutely appalled at his response. He not only was absolutely disrespectful, he threatened to send us a bill for the work that had been done to the trailer, send our information to ""management"" prior to hanging up on us. Please keep in mind, we didn't request any work be done, we never signed any paperwork promising to buy the trailer. 
If that isn't bad enough, we stopped in to get our holding deposit check back and they refused to give it to back to us.

We made the discovery at 9pm on Saturday night before a Monday morning departure. Since Camping World Meridian had winterized the trailer and then prepped it for summer I went to them on Monday morning for help. Their service department told me they could not look at the trailer until July 12 - seven days in the future. I had RV park reservations in 5 different places in the next 14 days and had to be on the road THAT DAY, but alas Camping World was entirely inflexible and would not offer ANY help until the following Monday. I had no choice but to leave and be on my way. We did manage to figure out what the problem was and get it fixed along our way - no thanks to Camping World.
Lessons learned:
1) DO NOT ==EVER== accept your RV for return to service without PERSONALLY checking out EVERY system BEFORE you sign the service documents
2) DO NOT ==EVER== expect help from Camping World in an emergency. Any emergency you may have is YOUR emergency, not theirs.
3) Seek out a place that will help you in event of an emergency and GO THERE for service",2021-07-23 17:58:29 UTC,1,0,1,0,KUYFbccLqIHIpkGkHGxhiA

When someone asks me about my trip to New Orleans, I tell them that one of my favorite things was the food, and there is no better way to experience it than this tour. 

Our guide as we embarked on this gastronomic adventure was Ben Wisdom. Ben was a terrific guide, very positive, upbeat, entertaining, and wicked knowledgeable. He also had stupendous recommendations for other places to check out while in NOLA.

Our journey into the world of New Orleans cocktails and food started with a delicious bowl of Alligator Sausage and Seafood Gumbo and a Hurricane. These were absolute heaven, and the gumbo remained the best I've had in New Orleans! Throughout the tour, I was able to try other New Orleans culinary and alcoholic staples, all of which were of top-notch quality. 

While the Food and Cocktail History Tour is a little on the expensive side, you get a full belly of food and four full-sized cocktails! Not to mention the phenomenal guide who will take you on this journey! 

One bit of criticism: I found the stop and Pepper Palace a little out of place, considering this is a chain with 100 (or more) locations. I didn't quite see how it fit into the overall tour of New Orleans cuisine. But, I will not let it go unsaid that free samples are always appreciated, even more so when they're unlimited! We also got a bottle of hot sauce to take home with us as part of the tour!

I have been recommending this tour to absolutely everyone, and here's me recommending it to you now.",2021-11-18 01:23:56 UTC,5,2,2,2,yNDZK-8sgJOW4KUHnrVFwQ

This was not your typical disgruntled gym douche- this guy was violent and aggressive and threatened me. I was called every name in the book out loud. I brought this to the attention of the staff and they were completely clueless on how to handle this situation. I was told ""as long as he isn't causing you bodily harm, there is nothing we can do because he is a member, you probably should leave"". I was completely flabbergasted at this response and in the meantime this guy was still shouting and cursing at me in front of them. I had to actually call the police and make a police report because this guy went so far as to threaten to physically assault me. At this point the manager (Jessica), was on the phone with him while he was referring to me as a ""bitch"" and ""Beta Male"" and ""Faggot"". By the time the police came he had left, but I was really shocked that this kind of behavior is tolerated at Sports West Reno. I have never witnessed in all my years with Sports west that sort of thing before, nor have I ever been treated with such degradation by someone in a public space. According to some sources nearby, this was not the first incident and situations like this are becoming more commonplace at Sports West.

I must have lucked out, because all the time I was there they didn't work on the rooms next to me at all.

Here are all the reason why I loved my stay.  1) Hot breakfast... sometimes the lines were long, but the lines moved quickly and they had bacon almost every day.  2) Manager's reception happy hour... every day they had a happy hour where you could get up to two drinks complementary.  I only took advantage of this once, but it was still a nice touch. 3) The room is was in was recently renovated... new carpet, decorations, a nice sized TV, VERY CLEAN, etc. When it comes to cleanliness my expectations are high and this hotel did not disappoint 4) Front desk staff... they were tentative to my needs and requests.

Where do I begin? Well I guess from the moment I got to the hotel since that's when it all started.
My sons spring break was this week and I planned a trip to Tampa, Fl for a relaxing mini vacation. I booked with the embassy because it is a higher tier Hilton hotel and the previous embassy hotels I have stayed at always exceeded any expectations/standards. Upon my arrival, I asked to be put on the highest floor available with a view. I was informed that it was possible and they would take care of me during my stay. (Well they definitely didn't) When I checked in I asked the front desk where the best fine dining in downtown Tampa. Her response was all chain related such as Bahama breeze, magianos, and chipotle. Okay well then, no big deal. We go to check out the room and we're on the 8th floor which is halfway up the hotel. Not the highest floor...Get this... not only did they not put us on a high floor they put us on the construction floor where all the rooms surrounding us were being renovated. WHAT? Oh just wait because there's a kicker to that. Also.... no view of the bay. IF I WAS ON A HIGHER FLOOR I WOULDVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE IT. Well they have reception hours every with snacks and 2 drinks per guest. As soon as we get up to the reception area the alarms start going off having everyone evacuate the building. Well that went on for 30 minutes and I was told there a maintenance issue with the hotel. So nerve wrecking and scary for me and my family. The alarm went off again shortly after for a brief period this time. While we were getting ready for dinner I asked for more towels and an extra cover to be delivered to my door and left. Hilton hotels have these no contact policies where they minimize the number of elevator guest, enforce masks, and of course delivery to the room NO CONTACT. I went to take a shower and got out to give my son a bath and was told someone knocked/called the phone. I go okay finally it's here, just to go check and see there's no towels/blankets. I call the front desk and was answered with a rude tone of voice informing me they tried calling many times and knocked on the door. (He was real aggressive with his tone of voice) I mentioned that I asked for them to be no contact delivery just like the rest of the Hilton hotels are doing. He mentions that this location DOESNT do that because they don't want to have any issues with stealing. STEALING? TOWELS? A SHEET? (Because he didn't bring me a blanket) LOL what? I'm at an embassy and you justify my comment with the thought of someone stealing something as simple as that? It's a health regulation that makes me feel safe. If I know someone is coming to my door and knocks... who is going to steal it in that time frame? I mean maybe, but  aren't there cameras in the hallways? ANYWAYS...
I was told it was going to be a while before they were able to bring it up because they didn't have time to waste OR I could come and get it. At this point, my son is in the bath WAITING FOR A TOWEL. I can't leave him in the room alone!? I had no choice BUT TO WAIT. So 35 minutes go by and we finally get our belongings. Still didn't enforce no contact. 
It really was just as if one inconveniencing thing after the other would happen.
So that night I set the thermostat to 73 heat and it was on 67 cold when I woke up. It was interrupting my sleep all night having me toss and turn. I cannot speak for everyone but I can't sleep in the cold. They were manually changing it from the front desk or it automatically resets, either way it was VERY DISRUPTIVE. We were told the pool was open, but when we go over to see it the next morning it was construction site with nails, tools, and just not feasible for me to bring my child over to the pool. That pool shouldn't be accessible. Such a safety hazard! The next morning was check-out and a Monday. I woke up at 6:30 and toss/turned until 8:30 because of the CONSTRUCTION GOING ON in the rooms on our floor. Ting ting ting, drilling noises, and loud thuds in the early morning isn't what you want to wake up to when you're on vacation, especially the morning you have to travel home. I just wanted to sleep in and have some peace and quiet. I mentioned to the front desk my want to speak with the hotel manager about all of these inconveniences. She reached out to the manager.  He was busy in a conference call but to take my number and name and he's be sure to get back to me. LOL. It's been over 24 hours and I still haven't heard anything. I truly do not feel valued as a gold member/team member with Hilton. Very upsetting experience. Just know Tampa was an awesome city and we loved it but didn't enjoy one bit of our stay at the Embassy Hilton at Westshore Tampa.

I have not missed a day of exercise for 2 1/2 months. I was so happy when the swimming pool opened back up. That is my go to choice for exercise. I started with three sets of laps and now I'm up to 30 sets of laps every day. Slowing down a bit once I get to 40 sets every day. 

However, now I am elated that the hot tub is open. You never Know what you miss until it's gone for so long. So happy! Now that the Hot tub is open, the masks are not required in most places, Covid vaccinations, and immunity once you get Covid... It almost feels normal.

I'm assuming the sauna is open also, but I am not a sauna person. Hot tub, swimming, stationary bike and a few free weights. Once in a while the stair climber or stair-stepper, but today I am super happy.

The pool--a main reason for booking it. Forget it it's not heated. I stayed at a different hotel in the area the next week and that pool was heated. This was freezing and had plastic, gloves, and leaves all in it. So I'm gonna debate if anyone checks the chemicals if they can't keep it clean.

I'm not experienced with working on trucks, I thought I could rely on the people that were supposedly ""experts"" on Toyota's to take care of my issue. As I explained to the person over the phone, and to Erica in person when I dropped my truck off, I had a rubbing sound coming from the front driver side wheel that intensified in speed and severity as the wheels of the car spin faster. I suspected a faulty wheel bearing from research I had done, and even had a mechanic friend give the same opinion. I explained this multiple times, was sold on a full inspection of the truck.

At no point in time did anyone ever check the wheel bearing. Which if left unattended to is a potentially life endangering safety hazard.

Instead, the technician Christian tried to blame the issue on an aftermarket upper control arm ball joint. If you don't know anything about UCAs or ball joints, not a single part of that makes sense. Nothing on the upper control arm spins with the wheel. So it's impossible for this to be related. 

Instead of checking the place I advised them and requested them to check multiple times, they decided it was easier to blame another manufacturer, attempt to get me to pay additionally to replace it, and lie to my face about the issue.

Save yourself a bunch of frustration and money and NEVER BRING YOUR CAR HERE TO BE SERVICED.

I've driven a Toyota since I got my first car so it was a no brainer to go to Dolan for my new one. I filled out a form online and requested email for my communication preference. They called instead but whatever, I set up a time to test driver the vehicle I was interested in. Last minute my plans changed and I had to cancel, I told the rep (who followed up via email about the test drive) as much and said I'd reschedule. Ten minutes before my cancelled appt, another rep called to let me know the vehicle was ready when I got there. I told him thanks but I'd already told his coworker I couldn't make it. He seemed frustrated and told me he'd call me Monday to reschedule (I hadn't asked...). He called today, Tuesday, to see when I could go for a test drive. At this point a third person had emailed me and I'd also told her that I wasn't ready yet. However, the rep who called today said that third person didn't work for Toyota but ""good luck."" I sent him screenshots of the email exchange but he didn't respond. I called him back because I thought he should know their site isn't secure since someone outside their organization was able to get my cell, email, and know the vehicle I was interested in. He said he'd call back in 10 minutes but it's been an hour. I called again but he didn't answer and his inbox was full.

1.  My ""check engine light"" came on 10/21/21 upon initial startup in the morning.  I called Dolan and was told the soonest appointment was Tuesday 10/26/21 and couldn't bring my Tacoma in until then.  In San Jose, dealers would at least have me bring in the vehicle the same day, even if they couldn't get to it until the next day or in the future, but usually the next day if not the same day.  As I travel a bit, I had to make a special trip to return back to the Reno area to bring in the truck.
2.  As I suspected, it was an oxygen sensor, but Dolan both didn't have the part in-stock, then ordered/received the wrong part, now Wednesday.  The correct part was finally received on Thursday and the warning light is now off.  While it was in, Dolan suggested and I agreed to have additional work done which doubled the price from $500 to ~$1000.
Summary, if necessary, Dolan might consider opening Service to 7 days/week;  in the last few years, I've probably gone to a San Jose dealership ~6 times, instead of Dolan as I could get an appointment sooner or right away.
allow vehicles to be dropped off even if Dolan can't yet get to the vehicle earlier;
looking at its parts inventory/system to hopefully have the part(s) either in stock or correctly ordered.

My first purchase was amazing from start to finish, every purchase since then has been a little worse. 

We recently looked to trade a vehicle that we purchased from them. It had very low milage, no damage, and very clean. The sales guy refused to tell us how much they would give us for the truck until I agreed to buy another car (they didn't even have the car I was looking for on the lot or in transit). I agreed to let them run my credit because if we could find the car I wanted then we would do a deal, only then did he tell me that they would only give me 5K LESS than I said was my absolute lowest trade value I would accept. Then he said if I traded my vehicle anywhere else I would have to cancel all my warranties through Dolan and they would only refund some stuff if I purchased a car through them. That's illegal so we left and went to Carson City Toyota (which was better than even my first car buying experience with Dolan). Carson was able to cancel some of my warranties for me but Dolan uses some warranties from third parties, which by the way are 1k more than a longer warranty through Toyota. Dolan had to cancel my extended warranty and they did refund me. The luxcare warranty, which they sales guy we talked to originally said I would've gotten credit for if I purchased though them, they now say is not cancelable. It is important to note that when I purchased the warranty I was told it was a protection for the inside and outside, it was positioned as and extended protection to fixed holes, scratches etc.  The service people that ""installed"" it said that it was a warranty on the inside and outside and that they just apply a special conditioner to the leather. Nothing else was done. I remember it clearly because when I picked my truck up it was still dirty (which I thought was strange at the time) and I had asked for a complimentary car wash but my magnets were still in place.  

Now, flash-forward 2.8 years when I try to cancel this ""warranty"" they tell me that I paid for a special spray to be put on my truck, inside and out, which wasn't done. When I said I was told I was paying for a warranty, and no spray was applied they pivot and say that I was paying for the protection against oxidation because really the cost of spray was minimal (seriously, that was in the same conversation). 

Dolan has been getting progressively worse. If I paid for a non-cancelable item 2.8 years ago they didn't deliver and the story just simply changes to fit the narrative I was given so they don't have to give me my money back, seemingly because I didn't purchase a vehicle through them - a vehicle they didn't have in stock or even on the way. 

I should've done more research on what the luxcare warranty really was rather than taking their word for it because now I am out money for something I never really received - I could've conditioned the leather myself for a lot less. 

I would caution anyone to buy from them, the sales guys are there one day and gone the next, and they lie to get your business. If you decide to buy from them I would really suggest you don't get any warranty from them.  Their warranties are more expensive and aren't what they claim. My family will never purchase from them again, it has been an expensive lesson.",2021-10-25 17:04:01 UTC,1,0,0,0,lXqtDT7jWSj6lq6X6IN8gg

The car died all of a sudden. I Had it towed to the Reno Toyota, they trouble-shot the problem and found it to be the main inverter (a major part of the hybrid systems) a $9k new part, the vehicle is not worth half the price, I thought I was screwed.  My only solution was a used one from a salvage yard but needed the exact one for my car.
John Mohundro my service manager got me into a new Highlander rental and I found an inverter in LA for only $300 this component must not go out very often since the demand must be low at such a discount. We were not 100% sure it would even work properly. The R&R was only $600~ plus the diagnosis and the used part, my car was fixed for about $1200 total, what a relief! John was absolutely awesome in helping me through this ordeal, kept in good contact and answered my questions honestly (a rarity in the automotive industry).
FYI, love my Highlander Hybrid, many more advantages than just better gas mileage! Also don't bring a Hybrid for anything technical anywhere else including any other so-called Toyota specialist including Carson Toyota dealer, they don't have a clue about hybrids!

Step 1. Walk in with a pre-approval from capital one. (also a current cap one auto loan holder)

Step 2. They submit insane numbers to Capital One so they come back with SEVERAL HUNDRED dollar higher payment and needing way more money down. Nobody in their right mind could accept this so I say no.

Step 4. They offer to go back with reworked numbers. They give more for the trade, they add in a discount etc... (in other words the real numbers)

Step 5. Get you to sign a contract telling you the whole time (even in writing) that they are only working with Capital One. You drive off.

Step 6. They now try to sell this contract to EVERYONE OTHER than Cap One. Bank after bank hit my credit report, Toyota finance hits my report etc... Capital One has nothing from them.

SO. I call Capital One. I show them the contract. OF COURSE THEY WOULD FINANCE IT AT THE RATE AND MONTHLY PAYMENT I WAS EXPECTING. 100% NO PROBLEM.  Took me 2 hours, had to talk to their supervisors to get it done but once I sent them the contract they didn't hesitate to take the deal. 

THIER OWN PARTNER tried to cheat them out of the loan and are using ME to do it. HOW DISGUSTING AND LOW. 

Now, they are calling the dealership to fight to get the loan that I walked in the door asking for in the first place AFTER my credit report takes the hit of all the inquiries. 

I would bet that RIGHT NOW as I TYPE this the dealership is preparing to notify me that they couldn't sell the loan as it was written. Even though Capital One approved it 100% and will honor it. 

Don't know how this will end, but I would strongly urge you to avoid them at all costs. There is no limit to what they will do to make an extra dollar. They DO NOT SELL CARS FIRST. THEY SELL FINANCING FIRST and will gladly commit fraud in writing to do so. 

SPOILER ALERT. Not IF, but WHEN you get the contract rewritten and need my signatures again, you can drive it out to me. I am not setting foot in your dealership again.",2021-07-27 17:45:25 UTC,1,0,0,0,UAn4_zV5ZIFyEyZqvd50Gw

With sales, I had Nate Pecson helping me out. I was in the market for a Lunar Rock 4Runner, and obviously I did some research on my own and checked other dealerships, so I was relieved to find out that Dolan was selling it at MSRP for the Pro. They put me on the wait list, and Nate was super accessible whether it be calling or texting me to keep me updated. He was super patient even though I kept bugging me about when my vehicle would arrive. They also gave me a good trade-in value for my Honda, which was actually even higher than what the Honda dealership was willing to give me since I had even looked at trading it in at Bill Pierce Honda.

When doing the financing part, I had Michael Parker who was super easy to work with, and made everything smooth. He was patient in explaining all the dealer add-ons, what it covered, and helped me get a good interest rate almost 1% lower than what my credit union approved me for. He also hooked it up with some options I added, but I also liked how he didn't pressure me into buying things when I wasn't interested. That's how it should be every time people buy cars.  
One thing that also stood out was when he saw my occupation, thanked me for helping the community, and just acknowledged what I do. That was beyond expectations. 
One random fun fact, I had also ran into Gordon Ryan at the airport, who flew from NY just to buy his Tacoma TRD Pro here at Dolan Reno, which also speaks volumes for people traveling this far to buy vehicles.

Not because of the vehicle, but because of the customer service I received at Dolan. I went in to get maintenance done on my car and had issues with one of my tires (which I had also mentioned previously when I went in but they told me it was due to the weather). This time around, I asked them if my tires were still under warranty because I was still having issues and originally they said yes until the end of November of this year. They looked at my tire and came back a quote for a new tire and then told me they weren't under warranty. I then asked Jorden to print me a copy of the ""expired"" warranty and that I would get tires elsewhere. He told me the leak was very minor and I'd be okay to just put air in it temporarily and he left. When Jorden came back, he told me they couldn't find it the warranty. Jorden also told me that because of the small leak, they may not allow me to leave without putting the spare or new tire on even though he had just told me it was minor and I'd be fine. Then he tried telling me I never purchased thru their Toyota Dealership and told me I'd need to go to Carson and became argumentative to the point where they told me I needed to provide them PROOF that I purchased my vehicle thru them and made me dig thru my glove compartment. Then when I found the paperwork, the manager came up to me and ""magically"" found me in their system. They told me my tire had a small leak but couldn't repair it because it was on the sidewall and asked Jorden to show me. When Jorden showed me and the manager the leak, the manager said it was tread that he was pointing to and I laughed and told them that was tread and can be repaired. The manager then told me they don't have the kit and would need to go somewhere else.

But please read on for the details.  

First, Bear in mind that you will be staying in the Arizona desert.   Mountains and cactus abound.  As does sand and gravel.   If that's your thing and you are comfortable with upscale pricing give this property a try.  Brilliantly landscaped and immaculately groomed the grounds are loaded with walkways and a diverse assortment of isolated sitting areas, bridges, running water, figurines and desert shrubbery.  

Our nicely appointed, isolated getaway was fantastic.   Everything that relaxation required was provided.  

Also bear in mind that you are about a half hour drive to Tuscon so if you need the stimulation of the urban setting rent a car.  

The theme here is unplug, disconnect, turn off your digitals and unwind.   Truly.  There are digital device-free zones that are taken seriously by the staff as well as a variety of artistic signage with mantras, quotes and quips suggesting all manner of ways and means to unhook.  Placards at the sinks in the men's locker suggest that while washing one's hands one should repeat 3 times ""I will unplug"".  So at first I thought ""yeah!""  

While laudable, the attempt at the relaxed ambiance ran a bit afoul of covid phobia.  My massage at the spa for example was interrupted more than once because my face mask did not fully cover my chin.  

Empowerment and diversity also thrive here together with the detached competence of the staff.  If you are looking to avoid personal interactions, patron-centered service and friendly chit chat with the staff this is your place. Also,  Estrogen abounds. And callous as that may seem I'm not kidding. For all but two encounters with female staff - which dominate in terms of numbers - my impression was they could care less. Not rude. Just indifferent.  Professional, polite,  but uncaring.  

There is one dining venue, a cocktail lounge and a smoothie/coffee/snack stop.  The menu's vary daily but count on healthy choices.  If your a meat'n potatoes person you're choices are limited.  

Lots to do.  There's a daily list of incredibly diverse activities from beekeeping to cooking.  

Spirituality is well represented with sessions in past lives, all manner of Yoga, psychic sessions and the like.  

Like I said.  If its your thing you'll love it.

At first, I thought it was just the usual relaxation resort. But I discovered amazing activities that I've never tried before and met lots of amazing people!

PRICE - 1/5
It maybe just me, but I'm not on the level yet to spend $3k/night and not flinch. Good news is, this is the biggest downside of the resort. So if you can afford it, give it a try. Oprah does send some of her people there. I did meet some people who were staying 1-2 weeks and 1 who owned his own $4M villa in the resort 

SERVICE - 5/5
90% of the staff look genuinely happy to be working there. I bet they're getting paid good money. I'm not sure if its just Arizonians, but whenever they interacted with guests and ask ""how are you?"" it feels genuine and not just a greeting. They do really want to know how your experience at the resort is going.

ACTIVITIES - 4/5
Some of my favorites:
Past Life Progression - If you're into spirituality and open to these kinds of things, its interesting to see a glimpse of your past life. If you're into that kind of thing, you'd just think its voodoo or nonsense
Cardio Drumming - Had an amazing experience, you have drumsticks and you pound them on the exercise ball, jump and even dance!
Yoga - It's just basic yoga but what I loved is, there's 2 huge windows and while practicing yoga, you have this beautiful view of the forest, mountains and the heavens as they seem to open up early in the morning
I also heard great things about hiking and mountain biking but haven't tried them.

FOOD - 4/5
Amazing food! I loved most of them because they weren't that heavy but they were delicious. Only downside is portions are small so I just ordered more. For a big boy like me, I usually ordered 2 appetizers, 2-3 entrees and 2 desserts. Plus they had this juice bar/cafe where you can stop by and grab snacks on the go or have smoothies/coffee made.
AMBIENCE/ROOM - 4/5
Not the most modern rooms, but it was the comfiest bed I've ever tried! It was like laying in clouds. They had different layers, and felt truly heavenly. I also liked how they designed the resort to have streaming/running water all around and you would be in a constant meditative state. It really felt relaxing staying in this resort.

OVERALL - 3/5
Biggest downside as I said above is price because its really really really high for me. Good news is if you have the moolah, why not right? Grateful for the experience to try out this wonderful resort!",2022-01-02 22:07:08 UTC,4,1,1,1,-_dMOs58OMAlYKMB5kEbsQ

I rarely write reviews and make exception for superior or disappointing businesses/services.  I stayed here pre-COVID and tried multiple times to speak to a management to relay my experiencence, but they refused to take my calls.  Some issues 1) Requested a quiet room. Placed me in a room directly across a huge fountain that ran 24/7. Difficult to sleep. Water would run into bathroom when took shower 2) Spa services - overpriced.  Massage given next to hut with loud drumming going on. Definitely not relaxing! 3) Cooking class - not organized, no recipe, class made one item. In contrast to Canyon Ranch where very organized, each group made an an item, able to enjoy excellent meal together, 4) Food not good & service not friendly - only exception was the smoothie bar in center of property, 5) Came here alone. Very disappointing that not told until my last day there was a community table for solo guests to eat together (ate most of my meals solo).

When I called to schedule the day and accompanying activities, I advised the experience planning concierge of the gift certificate. She confirmed via email, implying I was good to go. The day came and went, but lo and behold, I was charged the same amount (of the gift certificate) on my credit card. 

Therefore, I was none too pleased to spend unnecessary time out of my day to contact Miraval, communicate the situation, request they use their common sense and apply the funds on the already-paid-for gift certificate for my day package and additional services, and to please refund the amount charged to my card. This was completed in an expedient fashion, but I still had to expend extra energy on my end to watch my statement and ensure the refund posted. It was a frustrating and completely avoidable end to what was supposed to be a relaxing and decompressing day. 

Onto the day itself: I don't know how Miraval manages to have a ""Tucson"" address, because it's a ~30 min drive from Tucson proper, less if you're up north and more if you're coming from the south/east. The resort is actually in the town of Catalina.

The grounds are neatly manicured and tranquil. There are a few babbling brooks for ambiance, I suppose, if you like that sort of thing. I just feel the pools breed mosquitos. Customer service was generally excellent. I really enjoyed the variety of healthy smoothies offered at the Palm Court Cafe. 

The Cactus Flower Restaurant has indoor and outdoor seating; the tables are spaced out, I believe, for social distancing. However, I noted that the tables were kind of sticky, and there were flies I had to constantly shoo off my table and away from my food. I know it's difficult to keep the flies out, especially after the monsoon rains and the fact that the servers have to open doors to serve the folks seated outside, but the flies were a distraction from fully enjoying the meal. 

The meal itself at Cactus Flower left much to be desired. I had the soup du jour, or a tomato barley soup, which was very watery and lacking in much flavor. It felt ""limp"" and kind of like a can of Campbell's soup - all water, hardly any barley, and two token slices of mushroom. For the entree, I ordered the daily chef's creation, a barbecue pork with zucchini and cauliflower puree. There were 3-4 slices of pork (about the size of char siu pork) drizzled with bbq sauce. It was edible but hardly special. There was one okra-size zucchini, all atop a decent puree. Dessert consisted of 2 pistachio chocolate chip cookies. They were good, but it's a juvenile dessert for such an upscale (read: EXPENSIVE) resort. 

The saving grace was the Coyote Moon Bar & Lounge, whose food blew me away. For an afternoon snack, I ordered the black sesame somen, which was incredibly refreshing and tasted authentically and strongly of black sesame. I also got the house cured salmon, which I must say, is probably the best salmon I have ever had in my life. It was very fresh, the texture and flavor were perfect and went swimmingly with the quark creme fraiche. I think the food is all from the same kitchen, so I suppose it just depends on what you happen to order. 

I took a cardio drumming class and strength training class with Da Vinci body boards. The drumming class was fun and worked up a sweat; the body board class was intense and revealed conclusively how out of shape I am. The instructor of the Da Vinci body boards was funny and knows his stuff. My critique is that the room in which these classes take place, in the Body Mindfulness Center, is dated and it's a pretty small space. The locker room can also use a facelift. I don't think the bath towels should give off a light pink hue, but here we are. 

I squeezed in a deep desert massage and probiotic facial. The spa facilities are much better than the BMC - bigger and more updated. It also houses the spa amenities of a dry sauna, steam room (closed b/c of COVID), jacuzzi, and an enclosed outdoor space to lounge and relax. I especially liked the quiet room at the spa: a sitting room with large comfy lounge chairs that face a wall of windows showcasing a view of the mountains. 

My massage with Michael was mediocre. I like DEEP DEEP DEEEEEEP massages. I asked for more pressure, which he verbally acquiesced but didn't physically deliver. My facial was better, but I would've preferred more extractions, as upon inspecting my face afterwards, there could have been more extractions done.

My day's experience totaled $474, which is pricey, but I'd opt for a day package plus extras over staying overnight, which can average $2,000 PER NIGHT! Why pay 4x more for a dinner and roof over your head but access to the same facilities and activities? At that point, it's a situation of more dollars than sense.",2021-08-24 17:27:20 UTC,3,0,1,2,F7XtgdhbuQ1QqcnTOdKrYA

First I have to say as a spa treatment, NAGA. WOW!!! It's created movement with a silk cloth hanging from the ceiling. The therapist uses that to help stretch your body with their resistance to help your stretch and they massage out what doesn't belong. Incredible as I sit at my desk for hours, lack of stretching stiffens your body into a stress ball of our crazy days. This here is a treatment that just releases it all. I loved the height rope activities. Self sabotage is a large issue in our lives, to create a goal even if it is to get to 25 feet to the top only is the first accomplishments. What if I just push it and actually make it to the other side! I did it. What a feeling of ""wow, I can do anything if I just set my mind to it"". I loved common ground. The horse mirrors your behavior. I am going back for the 3rd time to see how I have grown with what I learned of bad behavior and intentional living to being intentional with strength. I can't wait.

Yes... you read the right. But, this is 100% my honest opinion regardless of how I got to Miraval. 

When we arrived at the airport my husband and I had a ride waiting for us just down the escalator. It was like a romance movie. Picture it... going down the escalator, view was blocked by a wall then BOOM... there he was my ride. Lol! 
We had a nice 50 minute ride to the resort. Our driver was great. He was so kind and helpful. 

When we arrived to the resort we signed some covid forms and received a quick tour. Shortly after the tour we headed to our room. 

When we arrived in our room our luggage was already there. That's when I realized that I was way out of my element. 

We went to a stretch class and then a mindfulness class. Both were a great start. all the classes we took we enjoyed. I plan to start meditating. The cooking classes were also wonderful. My husband really enjoyed them and we both learned so much. I'm not afraid of ""healthy"" food as m

The food was fantastic! So many options. Yes, portions are small. I love that and so did my husband. You can ask for multiple plates of whatever you want. If you want a triple portion of something say that. They will do their best. I loved that they were small so that we could taste food and give us options for when we get home to spice up our home cooking. There is something for everyone. So do not be scared. One review said they brought snacks, my husband and I had no issues and never felt hungry. Breakfast though made me wanting more out of it. Breakfast and lunch have a small menu and also a buffet. 
They have an area where you can get some grab n go items, smoothies, coffee, sandwiches, veggies n hummus, fruit and refill water bottles. That it open until 3pm I think and the cold food items are in the front cooler. 

Our room was wonderful. We were attached to one other room and never had any issues until the last night. Our neighbors had a loud movie or music playing 8-11pm. 

The spa was wonderful. You do not have to have a service appointment that day to enjoy it. So on my last night I went to the hot tub area for women, and then the outdoor patio. It was wonderful to just be able to relax in a quiet setting outside. 

In the end, we had a delightful time. It was nice to get away and honestly not have to really worry about anything. The staff was great, the property was beautiful and it was great to just stay on property and not have to get in a car to go anywhere. We will try to return in the future! 

These are some things to look into. I'm not taking away a star like I normally would because they were closed for 5 month due to covid and so am sure they may have a small staffing issue. 

1. Attention to detail. Rooms could be dusted and vacuumed in areas one would not normally go. Like behind the bed. At the mail salon the shelves were dusty as well. 

2. Communication. Our water fitness was canceled and we never knew. Myself and 5-6 other people waited and waited at the pool until I found a phone in the gym to call the front desk. I'm sure this is not what normally would happen. But, incase someone should have come to us down there just incase. I could have done a different class if I had known.",2021-12-31 01:03:16 UTC,5,5,1,6,obOH4EO1_3s5P9vhUzSsdg

No spa or hotel will ever feel good enough (and I've been to Ritz Carlton hotels, St Regis hotels, and some top spas in the Phoenix area). I read about the All the Buzz bee experience and knew if would be the perfect gift for my husbands birthday (who took beekeeping in college and loved it) after a rough 2020. This resort is pricey and I had Marriott points so we choose to stay at the Westin La Paloma (which was lovely) and do a day pass at Mirival. The day pass is a great value if you live in driving distance! I was overwhelmed by the level of service and attentiveness we experienced during our day at Mirival. It started from being warmly greeted by name at the front desk before we had even given our names to the front desk (the man assisting us in the parking lot must have radioed that we were walking up). 

The wonderful man who checked us in (whose name I have sadly forgotten because it's been a few months) wished my husband a happy birthday and gave us a little tour because we hadn't been there before. The personal touch and tour were much appreciated especially since it's a little overwhelming (in a good way) your first time. 

My husband was so surprised and impressed with Mirival. I hadn't told him where exactly we were going and even if I had told him we were going to a wellness resort he's the kind of guy who wouldn't have even know what that meant. 

The All The Buzz bee keeping experience was truly one of a kind. I learned so much and it's a great memory we will never forget. 
The spa was also top notch. During our spa visit we learned that a great horned owl had made her nest on the spa balcony. Mirival is wonderful at respecting nature and all its beauty and thus closed off the balcony to protect her and her babies. We were able to actually see her (the top of her head at least) from the pool area and it was incredible. 
Don't even get me started on the food! I'm a vegetarian and my husband had Celiac disease (gluten free). They were able to accommodate both of us and we loved every bite.

Unfortunately, a repugnant implicit bias incident, resulting in negative behavior toward a group of eight women of color plus Miraval's subsequent inadequate attempt at resolution have completely negated all positive feelings and experiences.  
 
 A simple, understandable, and forgivable error by Miraval staff caused an employee to speak to and treat our group in manner that was significantly less than acceptable.  The initial response by management appeared sincere and I felt confident my requests would be honored and an adequate resolution reached.  I was wrong; so, all grace I have has been exhausted because:
1. an appropriate and measured request for an apology from the staff person who insulted us was not honored. The reason offered was lack of knowledge of scheduling although I witnessed the staffer onsite for several hours after I shared our issue with management, leaving me to believe our experience was either acceptable or not especially important
2. implicit bias apparently neither rises to the level of having an audience with nor a phone call from the general manager.
3. and the financial resolution offered by Miraval did not rise to the level of the human indignity we suffered, placing me in a position to NEGOTIATE 'reparations' (word unfortunately used by management).  There should have been no need to negotiate.
I sincerely hope Hyatt and Miraval uses this incident to seek or re-enforce anti-bias education and cultural sensitivity training. The behavior of the staff member and the word choice of management clearly demonstrates a lack of cultural sensitivity at best....I will leave the worse unstated.
Until clear documented progress has been made, I strongly recommend the Salamander Resort and Spas to all individuals of color and their allies.",2021-03-17 14:57:51 UTC,2,0,1,5,4A3fEuqy7RxBu4rZJSkm0g

We were able to take part in all the activies and spa treatments we wanted because we booked when the schedule was released about 2 months before our trip.

I went in with high expectations and they were mostly met or exceeded.

I went solo on a Monday - Thursday and my sister-in-law, Alexa M, met me on Thursday for the day.  I highly recommend going solo -- especially if you are someone that doesn't ever take ""me"" time and are constantly going, going, going.  I needed the time for myself and it was the best gift.  I filled my days up with activities but also took downtime to read, sit outside, get pampered in the spa, etc... it was a bit outside of my comfort zone as well, but it was great!   

I love that the majority of the property is device-free... it really forces you to disconnect and be present in the moment.  I also appreciate that Miraval is a non-tipping resort property. One less thing to worry about so you can fully enjoy every moment and focus on overall wellness including your mind, body and spirit!

Some highlights of my stay were a trail run with Neil, step class with Pam, learning about and walking the labyrinth, yoga, mindfulness at miraval with Jessica, ""out on a limb"" with Don, and sessions with Alexandra Nicol, Rae Jessie, and Kristin Reece.

Daniel at the front desk and Adriana, the experience planner were extremely welcoming and kind.  

I was surprised that there was a dirty rag left in my room when I arrived and that there were a couple of spiders in my room + that housekeeping never came during my visit (perhaps Covid?). But I am overlooking those things and focusing on the positive, of which there was plenty.

A few months ago I dropped my car off for an oil change and tire rotation and although I had a morning appointment, they kept my car all day and over night.   I wasn't a happy trooper.

My most recent visit was due to an engine light staying on.   I made an appointment on-line, and because of COVID, I didn't want to sit there and wait.    Many of the workers sporadically wear masks, and I don't want to subject myself to that.   We dropped our car off the night before using the drop off box.   My appointment was for 9:30 am.    At 12:30 I hadn't heard anything so I called Craig, my service person and he said there were 2 cars in front of me?    WHAT?   I had a 9:30 appointment, how could I still have cars in front of me after 3 hours?   Why wasn't my car worked on at 9:30, which appointment was made based on other things I had going on that day?   He texted me at 2:30 to state that there were still 2 cars in front of me.    What's going on?   I called him.   He said it's like a doctor's office and that you wait until he can see you.    If I had been sitting there waiting since 9:30 my blood pressure would have been through the roof.   I asked to speak to the service manager.

This reminds me of a Seinfeld episode at a car rental agency.   They can take appointments but don't keep them.    I told them we needed the car back and that if they couldn't fix it by our picking it up at 4:30, then they shouldn't repair it.    We arrived at exactly 4:27 and the car was done.   7 hours to replace a sensor, which the service manager told me is a quick fix.   

We own two 2016 Rogues and I can't even fathom replacing them with another Nissan based on this poor service department.",2021-01-27 13:58:52 UTC,1,0,0,0,gZ6z2CEvCGp5gTfmZ74NaA

She's been paying on it for two years she received a notification from the from the finance company that she was possibly eligible to trade it in to get a better rate since her credit score 2 years ago was not very good so of course she had to pay higher interest rate. She decided to go there today to see what they could do for her and they told her they could do nothing so knowing what my credit score was I decided to go with her to cosign it and they don't even work with you they situate a table by yourself they go back-and-forth to do whatever it is that they do they don't even do it in front of you the next thing I know he comes out and tells me that he can't help her because my credit score is bad. Now I know that my credit score isn't bad so I questioned him and he got a little uppity about it So we walked out. Needless to say they didn't even really care if we walked out or not they didn't even try to see what they could do for us.

I I unfortunately had the pleasure of meeting good ole' Jonathan aka JQ and asked him to please work something out for us and to please give us his best offers and a price on a new Rogue.  He said he did.... so I moved on to another dealership and purchased a Kia.  

A few days later, I received a call from JQ and I kindly explained that we had already purchased a Kia.  He got mad and hung up on me!!  

Two days ago. October 2021, I contacted the Nissan dealership again, as we had been up there in August of 2021, to look at a new vehicle, but couldn't remember the guys name we dealt with at the time.  Again this time, unfortunately, I was in contact with ""Jonathan"", who said he was the one we had seen in August of 2021.  It certainly didn't sound like him, but okay.  We discussed what I was looking for and tried to work something out.  

He called back and up popped ""Jonathan JQ"" on my phone.  Okay, so he LIED and of course I didn't forget the time he hung up on me in 2019!!  

However, I was going to give him a chance.  I asked questions about the vehicle I was looking at.  The price was too much, so he offered to help with another vehicle.. a lower model.  

The following day, I asked him to please send me some new figures, because the price he was giving me for my Kia was way off.  He had the wrong model information.  He said he would do that and get back to me.  He never did... Then suddenly, it was my fault, because the vehicle had been sold.  I felt like I was talking to two different people at this point.   

Reaching a manager is impossible with this dealership and I clearly see why!!  They don't show any of their staff to the public, on their website.

PROS (95%) 
-So cute!!! We stayed in the Jacaranda room. Our room was so cutely decorated. Careful attention to detail was everywhere: the embroidered curtains exactly matched the embroidered bedspread and pillows. The little doilies on the nightstands. The pink striped wallpaper. 
-The house itself looks so cute from the street, especially with flowers blooming everywhere. 
-Breakfast was filling, healthy and delicious! The quality of the food was great--everything was homemade and fresh, a far cry from the plastic-packaged danishes and styrofoam bowls of cereal found at typical hotel continental breakfasts. 
-Staff were attentive and friendly, always. 
-The location was perfect for us. Close enough to walk to State Street, but far away enough that you don't hear the noise from the street. It is quiet and calm with birds chirping in the morning. 
-The little living room area with the tea, coffee, and cookies was the cherry on top. 

CONS (5%) 
-We didn't particularly care for the scent of the toiletries (palo santo, I think?) BUT they were cute and seemed high-quality. 
-Our key didn't work to open the front door (or at least, we couldn't figure it out) so we were unable to access the living area of the main house when the side door wasn't open.  

Our room was on the ground floor since it happened to be an ADA-equipped room. Next time, we would love to try one of the rooms on the 2nd or 3rd floors! Hope we can come back!",2021-05-12 18:07:37 UTC,4,1,0,0,PV6etd_M9h3ia3rwHxvFag

However my experience going to this Brandon Nissan dealership the last few times have been a total change and I won't be returning. I hadn't drove my vehicle for about a year due to covid and working from home, and when I needed to start again it had several dashboard indicators I wanted to resolve to make sure were working correctly. The breaks, a tire pressure, and an alert about being out of windshield fluid (pretty normal maintenance stuff). After their ""inspection"" of the car they said my windshield wiper container has a leak and the fluid would leak out, so I'd need a new one.. ok fine.. but they wanted to charge me 430 for an entire new system (I refused). so then I asked if there was a way they could turn off the alert since I wasn't going to fix the issue for that amount. The sales rep went to ask the service employee and came back to tell me, ""it's actually not a hole in the container it's the sensor that is bad and that will cost 160 (again I refused). 

I decided it wasn't worth it for me to spend that much just to have windshield wiper fluid. But wanted to test it out myself. I went to Walmart and paid 2.50 for a gallon of wiper fluid. it completely filled my car up, and I gave it some time expecting it to leak out... it just so happens there was absolutely NOtHING wrong with the container or the sensor, the car just needed wiper fluid as suspected. 

As a customer of Nissan, I have lost the confidence and the integrity in the service department. I can not logically trust the company to tell me the truth about what parts or systems in my car need an update or maintenance.


TLDR; Nissan wanted to charge me either $160 or $430 for parts on something that did not need to be repaired and the fluid was filled up for $2.50 at Walmart by myself.",2021-05-16 01:25:48 UTC,1,0,0,2,xoS0FVB8-XKJzMz2dhqO0A

Gave me my cashier's check back and I asked them since it is made out to Brandon Nissan, I don't know if the bank will take it back"" all they said was ""not my problem, it's your problem!"" 
I believe they sold the car twice and took the higher price. Does not make me very happy hence I will never go back to them.",2021-08-05 17:23:15 UTC,1,0,0,0,vzuGg9hnDuS4qZbPHPzQ0w

Because I was a upside down on the vehicle by a few thousand they asked if I would go up some from my current payment.  I said I have some wiggle room to increase the payment some and provided all of my documents to run the numbers. I was told  ok come in so we can have an estimate ran on the vehicle. I explained my concern sitting in the waiting area for a while  with Covid and my 5 year old but was willing to come in for an hour. He came back and said they can't run the deal because he misunderstood what I told him my current payment was and what I was looking for. I said that was fine and he said he will have the manager re-run the numbers and let me know. I said that's fine because this is not a need, more like I'm working on my credit and would like a lower interest rate but my car is fine. He tells me the next day the amount I'm upside down in is the problem.  I said ok. Let me know if it can't happen and that's fine. He says I'm still working with the managers to get you the deal. This started over a week ago. So today I ask, if I put 500.00 down would it make a difference? And the response I got was , ""can you come down today because I have some people from Nissan here that can review your information"". I explained that I was already there, provides all of my information needed to see if the approval is a possibility and I explained beforehand how uncomfortable I was sitting in a waiting area for an extended amount of time. I lost multiple friends and family to covid so I'm a little un easy for an extended time. And I explained that I made all of this known prior to sending information at all. I didn't want to waste their time or mine and not trying to be difficult. I said I didn't understand why I had to come back to sit there again when they had my information already. He said all I can't do anything without you here and the problem is your credit isn't good and you owe more then the car is worth, which again he already knew so why would I need to be present. At this point I was so over it even when I can get bigger down payment I would not go to them. I get you work on commission, but have some type of human reaction. You guys called me back and still I have to do the running around.

I returned to Brandon Nissan at 2:30 PM to discover my truck had not been touched. Two hours later - six hours after I dropped the truck off - I was informed that the software used to update the computer corrupted it and I could take the truck. Then it went from bad to worse as I was told several different stories as to what was a matter with my truck. Finally, I learned that Brandon Nissan knew the software that is used for the updates has and will corrupt about two percent of the vehicles it is plugged into and the ""radio head"" needs to be replaced, but only after getting approval from Nissan corporate, which took all of Thursday into Friday morning. Once it was approved a replacement part will be shipped, and it would take another five days for Brandon Nissan to receive the part. So, my simple repair will take up to eight days to complete. When I asked why won't Nissan corporate over night the part so I can get my truck back, I told they aren't allowed to do that!

It was horrible, overpriced, and nothing like advertised. For $50 a ticket, and a rather great idea, this could have been a very good, unique event. We did the 8:00 ride on 10/29. We got there about 7:30 (because the ticket says to arrive a half hour early). They board you with your group and you walk through a mini haunted house before boarding. Then when you get to the train car, they have creepy purple lighting in the dark. They have an attendant offering beer or hard seltzer for $5. We took advantage of that. Then the ride starts and the car fills with fog. Everything is promising so far! And then the same five ""actors"" you encountered in the mini haunted house walk from the back of the car to the front. In the same costumes. There is some kind of narration they play through the speaker systems but it is played so low, you can't hear a word of it. Then the same five actors run from the front of the car to the back again on the way back to the station. That's it. While the ride is exactly 40 minutes, you probably go about 2 miles and half that time you are stopped on the tracks while they work on reversing the train to go back to the station. There is a conductor who walks through the car on the way back to tell you how yo exit once the train pulls back into the station. Good thing the people sitting next to us heard him because we didn't. We were back in our car at 8:42. They have a parking attendant assisting people on the way out. You scan the ticket you get upon entrance to the parking lot. We thought maybe it'd be $10. Nope! $26 an HOUR for parking. We really felt robbed. We dropped almost $150 for a totally sloppy, half assed experience that lasted 40 minutes. Again, this could have been a really cool Halloween experience! A haunted train ride into the unknown. How cool that could be. And should have been. Instead, you really do leave feeling robbed of your money and your time.

We journey our way to New Hope, PA for a train ride. The pictures on their Facebook page and various YouTube videos make it look great. What caught my attention was they were celebrating their 55th anniversary. You get a complimentary souvenir ticket. I was hoping the souvenir ticket be printed on higher quality paper that would help make the ticket feel more vintage and throwback. It felt like a take out menu paper...

We boarded the open car train which was the last car. The openness made it feel very comfortable while waiting to depart at the station. As we took off and rolled by the town and waved at onlookers, the excursion headed through the backyards of people's homes. I thought the views would be more spectacular but we were pretty much looking at the woods and rich people's pools, fancy driveways and garages.

Next thing you know, the ride comes to a stop and the engine turns around and make its way back into town. The ride was fairly short. Coal ashes were blowing into everyone's eyes and faces. There is also beverage and snack service on the train. 

Verdict - Do it for the kids. Both my boys love trains and this was their first time riding on steam engine. This ride is more of a one and done experience for me. There's really not much of a reason to ride it a second time around unless the locomotive travels further and discount the tickets a bit. For most people, taking pictures at the station is more than enough to make it memorable. The ride is just too short and not very scenic during the summer. Perhaps the fall foliage would make this excursion more worthy of your time.",2021-10-27 21:05:06 UTC,3,1,0,3,UZOmlkSamDJoJFz-POZgVg

My family and I took the Fall Excursion Steam Train on Saturday, October ninth. Upon arriving at the station we were instructed by a parking attendant to drive towards the back of the parking area. After driving down about a quarter mile, we found parking in a dirt area overgrown with weeds. The parking lot had about thirty blacktop parking spots everybody else was parked in the weeds, grass, or in the dirt. Parking for just under three hours cost thirty-eight dollars! Quite a ripoff to park my car in the dirt and weeds in my opinion.

My family and I purchased three seats for the train ride. I arrived to the train station early and when we got onto the train, there was only one bench open for us to sit on. My wife, my son, and myself had to sit in two seats.  So my son was on either my wife's lap or mine the entire ride. He is four and a half years old. Other passengers who had only purchased two tickets, had multiple benches though. Or they had a full bench for themselves and their purse. There were no employees to assign seats or enforce any ticketing policy on the train. When one employee came onboard finally, the same employee who was scanning tickets, I brought this to his attention and he basically told me there was nothing to be done. That is not ok. You should enforce the ticketing policy you stand by. If I have to buy three tickets, I should get three seats. The train was obviously oversold if they were instructing people to stand on the observation deck,  and I only had two seats even though I paid for three. 

I have attempted to contact the New Hope New Hope Railroad once via phone call and twice via e-mail about my experience. The person on the phone was just a ticket salesperson and could not help me. I did receive a generic e-mail from a Susan A but when I responded I never heard anything back.  I would not recommend using the New Hope Railroad. They have no customer service, rip you off on parking, and do not care about their customers' experiences. I would still appreciate somebody from management contacting me but I doubt that will ever happen.",2021-10-22 10:49:42 UTC,1,0,0,1,C2M41MDKBVRU-KeR4CMUIw

It did not give a description of what to expect. Tickets were scanned and we were the first in line. An actor led us in to a room that was totally closed in. It was unexpected and I am very claustrophobic. I told him that and he literally pushed me into the room by my back  and the door slammed behind me. I knew this wasn't going to be fun for me  I won't give anymore away but by the time we reached the train car that we would be in I was not happy. It wasn't fun for me. The train car was also very hot and smoky with fog which didn't help when you're feeling overwhelmed.  I asked to get off and I did. I was told no refunds or exchanges. They should let people know that this event is maybe not for everyone. I'm not interested in a badly executed semi scare fest. I was so disappointed after being excited to ride the train.

I have been wanting to do this for years and was very excited to finally go. Our train was supposed to leave at 10 pm and last forty minutes as stated on the website. We left the station at 10:11 and returned at 10:39, giving us a 28 minute experience. To make it worse, the actors were not present at all during the second half of the train when we began heading back to the station. Which means we were being ""scared"" for about 14 minutes altogether. However, nothing about this was scary! There were 6 actors altogether, the same 6 who are present in the walk through experience that you do before boarding. The actors each ran through each car twice, in groups of two - once to the front, and then once to the back, and that was it! It was predictable because they went through in two's and engaged in the same act that they did during the walk through. They went through the train VERY quickly and engaged in cheesy dialogue with a few passengers and did absolutely nothing scary. One actor (a butcher I believe) literally did not say anything or even move. The entire experience was more humor than it was horror. I understand the actors were likely tired, understaffed, etc, but we paid $60 a person for this and I feel embarrassed for bringing my friends along. There is so much potential to do some real scaring here and this is an absolute flop. Based on past years' reviews, nothing has changed to make this better. I truly feel for the customers who have already purchased tickets throughout the month considering most dates/times are sold out, because this is a complete waste of money. Most Halloween activities are FAR cheaper and you can get at least a full hour worth of genuine scares, sometimes even longer!

The sign before boarding said that masks are required for the train, however, one of the first passengers on board asked if we needed to wear them if we were in the open air car and they said no. I would not have minded wearing a mask, but it was nice that we did not have to.

There were not that many people on the train, so thankfully we were able to be distanced a good amount.

It was neat that they offered us drinks (even though it wasn't technically the dining car) and we also had the opportunity to get our picture taken professionally if we wanted to which was cool. 

The ride was very scenic and I liked hearing the different historical facts about New Hope/the railroad.

Some of the local homes near the train even stood outside their homes to wave at us which I thought was cute!

Overall I had a good experience with the train! The only downside is I think the train ride is just a little costly - my husband paid roughly $37.50 a person for the four of us, so that was $150. The train ride is an hour though which is nice.",2021-06-21 15:34:20 UTC,4,1,1,3,Lbk8z4OKEebvuWQP1WttoQ

Boarding starts 30 minutes before departure. So getting here a hour before your time is enough time to look around, take photos and get on the train.

Snacks and beverages. The VIP train car is SUPER warm!!! Had to take off some layers. Found out that this exact train car was the one that the famous David Copperfield made disappear 30 years ago in the airport hanger!!!! Wow what history! Haven't even left the station yet!!! 

Oh my goodness Santa!!! A good Santa too!! He came on and started interacting with the kids right away!!!! Which is great since ""mall"" Santa's no longer can due to covid restrictions! Almost made me cry lol always going to kid at heart.  There was a guy with a banjo signing Christmas music and other songs. 

The train goes for about 30 minutes, stops and starts heading back. If you have a sensitivity to motion sickness, where bands and take something for it cause the train rocks. You're not going a high speed so you feel everything.

Save your money.

It is not scary.  Not even a little bit.  Not even at all.  There is a lot of fog   There are maybe three to four actors.  They walk through the train twice and basically just talk to passengers.  The train goes up the track ....sits.  the train goes backwards down the track and you get off.  THAT'S IT.

You pay more than $100 for two people plus an outrageously ridiculous amount of money to park...$26 for an hour.... To ride a smoke filled train up the track and back with literally no scares.  Seriously do not do this unless you enjoy flushing money down the toilet.  There are a lot of great....and far more reasonably priced... haunted attractions out there.  Do one of those.  You will have way more fun.  We left feeling completely ripped off and disappointed.  Everyone else on the train did too.  Literally everyone was talking about how weak and overpriced it was.

We trecked up to New Hope, PA for one of the final rides of Santa's Steam Train rides for the year! 

We arrived to the station  about 45 minutes before 12pm, a little earlier than requested (requested: 30 minutes before departure) which was the perfect amount of time to snap some photos of and near the train, shop the gift shop and grab our cocoa before boarding.

Once on our car attendant greeted us and engaged with us promptly, as he did with every guest who came aboard. He asked if we wanted some Bailey's for our cocoa (okay!) and promptly brought us our drinks and two fresh chocolate chip cookies.

The train departed the station promptly and within moments the magic couple themselves entered the first class cabin, greeting everyone with gifts for the children and taking pictures with all who wanted on. Once Mr. and Mrs. Clause were done, the musical stylings of the local banjo player were on deck to do sing along Christmas Caroles and even a rendition of ""Fly Eagles Fly""!

An hour nearly to the minute after we left, we were back at the station, we were told we could try to stick around to see if we could go up to the engine, we opted to head down the road to find lunch.

All in all, a great experience, the only reason we missed a fifth star here is because it was SUPER HOT on the train.

******************************************

EDIT: I originally wrote this review immediately following the experience while eating at the local pizza place. Two things quickly cost this experience 2 stars...

1. I had forgotten the tickets were $322 for two adults, it was NOT an experience of that value. The price should easily be cut in half. Go to the platform, take your steam engine pictures then jump on any other train if you just want to ride on a train... Message me and I'll come play Santa if everyone chips in an additional $10!

For this price we should have left with more than a cookie, cocoa and a novelty North Pole train ticket, a small goody bag with souvenirs, professional photos by the train and/or with Santa. Even a Christmas ornament with NHR logo on one side and ""Santa Steam Train"" on the other side would have helped bump the value.

2. Parking at the train station was $44 for like two hours, in fairness the car attendant warned us of this, but only after we were parked and on the train. At purchase and pre-arrival they don't tell you and actually encourage you to park there. On the way in, if pricing is listed, it's not obvious. Park on the street or next door at the metered shopping area.

******************************************

Fun fact: The car we were in was commissioned in 1949, serviced the Midwest before going to Alaska for a time, was then purchased by the Orient Express, and was the same car magician David Copperfield made vanish (really special to us as my wife and I are big fans of Copperfield)

Sugguestion: The farthest out point is supposed to be the ""North Pole"", it would have been great if they had need able to decorate it some, but this by no means took away from the experience overall.

We will absolutely consider other rides like the Wine and Tapas or Halloween versions!",2021-12-26 18:54:28 UTC,2,0,0,0,cvksIhrpfRjtx9NeCZNHGw

If you have not yet booked your tickets, DON'T! I recommend looking at more reasonably priced places where you will likely have a much better experience. We rode Santa's Steam Train Ride on Sunday night. The website advertised holiday music, Santa and Mrs. Claus, fresh baked cookies & hot chocolate, and that Santa would give each child a special gift (a bell). This is what we got: 10 minutes of Christmas carols and then it was silent the rest of the ride, a cold cookie while the train waited for 15-20 to turn around, and Santa. There was no hot chocolate served, no Mrs. Claus, and certainly no gift from Santa. One employee told us the ""just didn't do hot chocolate today"" and another told me they could not serve it because of Covid. I also paid for a picture package which said I would get unlimited digital downloads of the pictures as well as a 5 x 7. That night I was told the picture would be sent in the mail and the others emailed. What a joke! I still have not received my digital photos which should have been sent immediately. When I spoke to a manager after our ride asking about all of the things that were missing that were advertised on the website, he seemed surprised that these things were on the website. Then, in front of my daughter (who whole heartedly believes in Santa) he says, ""We have 4 Mrs. Clauses I don't know why you didn't have one. There were 2 on that train."" She never ever ever doubted the magic of Christmas until that moment. He literally ruined it for her. To make matters worse, there is nothing on the website about parking, nor is anything mentioned when you purchase tickets. I received an email the day before our ride mentioning that parking was not included and that I had to go to the ezpark website for more info. It was $26 for the first 2 hours and then $6/hr after which a maximum of $62.00!! This was on top of the over $400 we spent for our family of 4. This parking rate gets you a spot far away in the dark, with no parking attendants or sidewalk until farther up. It was a complete and total scam. The manager that I spoke to blew off my concerns in person and did not seem at all concerned that we had a horrible experience. I don't normally write reviews, but I felt as though families need to know what they are walking into. It is complete false advertising; you will not get what they say they will provide.

The service was bizarre.  Lacked efficiency- took forever to load the train in the cold, rainy weather because they had one person taking passengers to their assigned tables.  They should have had a better system - like read off the last names of the reservation to take all passengers to their assigned car in a group.  Otherwise, more than one person should have been seating passengers.  When we boarded the train they started by serving bagels, and not coffee.  We waited for quite a while for coffee and then they only had flavored creamers and no plain milk or half and half.  The main breakfast plate had ice cold food, burned French toast and the potatoes were like cardboard.  The images of the breakfast on the website are very deceiving.  There was also no butter for the bagel or the French toast.  I wish I had taken pictures.  We could not stop giggling about what a mess the experience was.  When I asked for the bathroom the waiter (who did not seem new as he talked about other rides and knew many facts about the train's history) seemed confused and then said  'I think on the next car - maybe?'.  Weird.  The complimentary mimosas tasted like they were made with diesel fuel.   The waiter tried charging us for the mimosas. So I had to point out that they were included with our ticket/breakfast.  In my opinion, the business needs to up it's food and service game.  There really is no reason for such poor quality of either.

TLDR: GO SOMEWHERE ELSE AND AVOID THIS LIKE IT WERE A PLAGUE ZOMBIE.

A group of friends and I bought our tickets weeks in advance and were really looking forward to a Halloween Attraction that featured the use of a locomotive. The idea of combining train stops, ghostly tales, and some jump scares seems like a recipe for a great time. 

We arrive for the 10pm train ride and get checked in. We are walked to the entrance platform which has been decorated with HO HO HO written on the walls, bathed in blacklight - a bit strange but could be a scary twist on Christmas. Walking through the station we come upon a scary butcher, a mutant couple with a baby, and someone dressed in a robe similar to that worn by the Ghost of Christmas Present with antlers on their head.
We are escorted onto the train which is filled with fog machine smoke and the purple light cast by blacklights. We take our seats and wait for the other passengers to arrive.

Then we wait. And wait. And wait. This seems like the perfect time to build tension and to have someone on a PA system tell the passengers something disturbing or even some good jump scares - but no, none of that happens. Instead you sit in your seat as the fog machine fills the traincar with so much smoke that you cannot make out what is five feet in front of you.

The train begins to move. You hear doors behind you open and slam shut. Then you are met with the mutant couple from the station. Then the butcher. Then the man in the robe. They pass by making their way to the front of the train.

The train comes to a stop. And you wait. And wait. Choking on fog machine smoke the whole time. Then the train begins to move in reverse, returning to the station. And then you disembark. THAT IS IT.

Ten minutes later chatting with my friends at Frans Pub, we are discussing what went right and what went wrong. The consensus was that ambience is there, but that alone cannot carry a haunted attraction. This group needs some help with crafting their act. A great idea, poorly executed is what we have here.

The ticket price was way too much for what the audience received. The price for parking was also ridiculous at nearly $30 to park for an hour. This must have been the brain child of a greedy township official to wring money out of people and give nothing in return.",2021-10-23 15:09:53 UTC,1,0,0,7,u5QwsIAtE-0tCpoJvSz-gQ

We followed the sign to the New Hope railroad and pulled into the parking lot. We realized it was a paid lot but we were already into the lot with cars behind us. There are no people at all to talk to so we parked our car. We decided to go a little early and enjoy the quaint town of New Hope, had a nice lunch then took our 2 hour train ride, we thought we were going to see beautiful scenery and fall foliage-well we saw dead trees, trash and old rail road ties. There was a man talking over a microphone telling a little background history    Of the railroad and the area of New Hope. With the rude people talking and the speaker not that loud, it was hard or impossible to hear exactly what he was saying. So-we take our 2hour boring train ride and we go to pay for our parking . Holy Moly- we paid 62.00 on top of the 200.00 for the train tickets!! Never again and I would discourage anyone who wants to go - go somewhere else and don't waste your money!!

For $57 in the town of New Hope during Halloween season we had high expectations for some great spooky fun.  When we parked at the train station we thought we were in for something special as the train station was decked out in tastefully well done Halloween decor. However, when it was our turn to board the haunted train ride, we quickly realized our hopeful expectations were about to be busted.  The first train car we walked through made an attempt to scare us with the usual creepy blood and gore scenarios. Then we entered a plain passenger train with very meager attempts at decor ... some purple string lights and a few dangling bones.  As you ride through New Hope in the dark of night, there is nothing to look at out the windows except for a few homes along the tracks with occupants watching TV inside.  Meanwhile in the train, we think we hear a recording of something but it's impossible to hear what is being said because of the rowdy drunk group of people in the front of the train.   The 4 or 5 pathetically dressed actors are running up and down the train aisles looking for a baby... I think.  The actors are dressed in torn and shabby Christmas outfits.  If there was a story line, we missed it.  The clincher ....$62 to leave the parking lot.  Save your money.  This was a bust.",2021-11-04 21:01:04 UTC,1,0,0,1,GRqVfrt3zs6YUY8gHN70KA

We spent extra money to be more comfortable and ended up worse off for it, because the people who spent less money than we did at least had air to breathe rather than being in a sweat box next to broken windows that didn't open. 
To make matters worse, the entire time we had to endure a super loud presentation by a guy who talked about the fine minutiae of the history of trains in a monotone and grating tone, without ever taking a breath or pause. It was excruciating. It was like being stuck in a sauna with Sheldon from The Big Bang Theory and all I wanted was to be out of that situation as quickly as possible.

I can summarize the entire experience in three bullets: 
1) You enter the train by walking through a standard, small scare maze with 5-6 scare actors 
2) You travel about 15 minutes in Smokey train cars, where the same actors pass by for a 2-3 minute period 
3) Repeat bullet #2 but in the opposite direction 

That was it...... I wish I could say it was better, because I think this could be a really awesome experience. But unfortunately it was cheap, boring, barely scary, and felt like a slap in the face for the price you pay. The only two positives are the train is itself is historic and cool, and the actors were good at what they do. But that unfortunately does not redeem the experience. There are dozens of other haunt experiences in the area that you can spend a fraction of the money on and get 10x the better experience",2021-10-10 14:15:08 UTC,1,0,0,2,W_4ROmAS4h32zsYNU2NKDg

My horror fan husband was keen to take the New Hope Railroad's 'Haunted Halloween' train. He loved the concept and was curious to see how they pulled it off. I said, ""sure"" a little too quickly. If I had taken time to read reviews before he slapped down $60+ per ticket, I would have said, ""Hmmmmm, Methinks not.""

I did, however, read the reviews after he had purchased our nonrefundable tickets, but before we actually went. So, I was at least forewarned about the criminally-expensive parking lot adjacent to the train platform. $26 for 0-2 hours and $6 for every-half hour after that! WTF? [New Hope Railroad's PR person has said, in response to some reviews that complain about the price of the parking in this lot that it is independently owned and not associated with the railroad. BUT, New Hope Railroad provides information about this lot on their website AND there are pay kiosks for the parking on their station platform. So, yeah, New Hope Railroad is complicit in this.] 

We parked a different lot, about two minutes away, and paid only $4 for nearly three hours parking.

Moving on...despite the fact that there are signs on the platform and information on their website indicating face masks are required in enclosed cars for anyone (guest or crew) aged 2 or over, this was not in any way enforced. Almost all passengers and at least one crew member were not wearing masks. This in a tiny enclosed space, with zero social distancing possible, with no air circulating, and that was filled with theatrical smoke. As such, our little train car did double duty as a perfect Covid petri dish. So, New Hope Railroad, contrary to what it says on your website, safety is apparently not your #1 priority.

To say the ride itself was lacking would be an understatement. As mentioned, I'd read some reviews before going, so I mostly knew what to expect. And, it was just that bad. We boarded by party, walking through a train car decked out as a not-particularly-scary 'haunted house.' Then we were seated--in the dark, smoke-filled train car, amongst the maskless masses--while the rest of the passengers boarded. Then we left. Rode about 15 minutes in the dark. When I first heard about the Halloween train, I though there would haunts along the way. Stuff to see. But, no, there was just dark. Husband got excited when he saw some lights ahead, thinking something was finally going to happen. But, it was just the railroad crossing lights. Then, we were back to dark. We eventually stopped and sat there--in the dark, with nothing happening--for about ten minutes. Then, we drove backwards back to the station. And, that was it.

I guess what makes me most angry about this total waste of our time and money is that the negative reviews of the Halloween train go back several years. So, New Hope Railroad knows how bad it is, but just keeps doing it year after year, getting new suckers to pay exorbitant fees for a worthless experience. I'll definitely not be riding on any train New Hope Railroad has to offer ever again.",2021-11-02 03:02:58 UTC,1,0,0,1,r6x__i0Wg3vg_lqi0TZitg

Their prices are good ! It's $12 for a regular bike for an hour or $22 for 2 hrs. The electric bikes are $25 an hour or $45 for 2 he and I think $59 for 4 hrs. They have two different kinds of electric bikes. They have the fat tire ones which have pedal assist or you can use the throttle on the handle bar and just go all electric and the other ones they have are only pedal assist.

We Rented two bikes this weekend. At first they only had the electric bikes that go when you pedal ! They were super fun and go up to at least 20 mphs. Fair easily to ride and you can still coast on them. We took the bike path all up and down the coast. They go up hill pretty easy which is nice too. After an hour we decided to go back and see if the fat tire bikes were available 

We were lucky and there was some and the staff was so nice that since we rented bikes for 2 hours they let us swap out for the fat tire bikes for our last hour with ease and man lemme tell you those fat tire bikes Are fun. You just throttle and go and they reach pretty fast speeds too, at least 20mph if not faster. We covered a lot of land in 2 hours. 

Definitely recommend this place. It was nice just cruising Round",2021-03-22 00:23:43 UTC,5,0,0,0,pe9B6_ujE289JCzGRwdBwg

This was unexpectedly a really fun experience! Each time I went with friends, we got the single surrey for an hour ($40). Split amongst everyone, it comes to about $10 per person. One person is in charge of driving/ steering while everyone else joins in to pedal. The workers give you instructions at the beginning on how to brake the surrey and then you're on your own. It is overwhelming the first time you exit since you're riding along the street but once you're on the sidewalk, you feel safer. 

There are two paths you can take. The first time, my two friends and I struggled to finish the route that leads left within an hour. We even got caught at the bottom of a bit of a decline and a couple of strangers came to help push us. It was embarrassing but also hilarious. 

The second time I rented out a surrey, we managed to get through the entire route with a total of four of us. Having 4 total passengers makes the experience a lot easier. We were able to stop by the grass to enjoy some outdoor music. They do give you about a 10-15 minute window to turn in your surrey so you don't have to pay for the extra hour. If you do go over, the additional hour is just an additional $10.",2021-10-10 05:42:58 UTC,5,0,0,0,5xTvncKcfgrEpRsch2YlDQ

The 1 hr was more than enough -- the pedaling is tiring! The bike lane along the shore was so beautiful & overall we had a really pleasant and fun ride.

While trying to pick out a small helmet that wasn't clearly marked he snapped at me and rushed us along. But the experience at this location was altogether different! We rented a double surrey for 3 people (two adults and a 10 year old). We could have gone with the single but have done that in the past a felt a bit tight. The shop employee who set us up with the surrey was very kind and friendly. There was a bit of a wait once we paid but it went quickly and the shop employee was kind and helpful. He gave 10 extra minutes since the clock starts right after you pay. A suggested  route map is clearly displayed for the person steering and fellow peddlers. We followed the route to the bird lagoon. It was a nice ride and mostly flat. Returning the bike was easy. Will definitely do this with Wheel Fun Rentals again!,2021-04-09 00:25:28 UTC,5,0,0,0,4esEZUhgi_-VZVkn3FmJNA

We told them our location and Henry rode a replacement bike to our location while we waited .
We had a great time.  Rode our bikes to Montecito and had brunch.
When we returned the bikes, the manager gave us a discount due to time lost and inconvenience. 
Suggestions 
1. Give guests a tutorial on how to use the bikes. The gears are different from what we were used to. It's a diagram of a stick-man on a bike
2. Offer to guests bike locks and    baskets and that the bike lock combo is on the receipt 
3. Offer maps if needed

Lately we have chosen to drive the extra 30 miles or so to st Charles because we have had a few bad experiences at river city in a row.  Tonight we decided to give it one last try.  Granted we never expect to win on the slots but we definitely want to be entertained and have a good time.  Tonight at river city is a joke.  This place is packed full of people but yet there are no self serve drinks open, no bars, and no waitresses/waiters.  I understand there is a pandemic but you don't have every other seat blocked off and you lifted your mask mandate so im not sure why you chose to shut off the drink stations.  The line for the only bar that is open has at least a 30 minute wait.  In addition it has to be almost 80 degrees in this casino right now so not having any drink options is insane.  One last comment that seems to be common at river city is the extremely tight machines and no rewards for members.  We gambled for maybe an hour and during that time neither one of had a spin that paid us more than cost of the bet.  Not once!  As we were looking around I would say over half if not most of the people in the slot areas were playing in their phones or just watching other people lose.  In fact I'm sitting here writing a review about your lack of service.  The location of river city is great and it used to be a good place to have dinner, gamble a bit, and have some fun.  Now it's just a sauna with no drinks that sucks you're money away.  Perhaps that's the new mission of the casino...  no drinks so you hurry up and gamble to leave faster.  Believe me I realize I'm a small fish in a big pond and my 5 grand or so a year that I spend at casinos means nothing to you guys as you have proven to me multiple times.  I'm writing this to let others know there are much better options in the St. Louis area.",2021-05-31 04:02:36 UTC,1,0,0,2,MQJ-l2kyl6gHclUTV6bHag

Other than having solid Wi-Fi this place to not meet Any of the reasons why I stayed here and on top of that my $150 room cost me $180 a night because of $30 worth of taxes that they don't tell you about. Plus they charge you a $50 fee that I'm not really sure what for. So my $300 I expected to pay for two days turned into $425 for two days. The four restaurants on site were not open other than a fast food Chinese place that was only open after 6 PM. So no breakfast I know lunch. I decided to go down to the casino to have a drink after an hour and a half I finally found a waitress I ordered a drink and it was four dollars. Waitress never came back so I went up to the bar ordered that same drink and he charged me five dollars. I asked him why the drinks were cheaper with the waitresses and he told me that he only uses premium vodka for his walk up customers....

Originally, we visited because we wanted to rent out a moke, butt apparently they didn't have any (although we did see one in the back, it was probably charging though). So instead we rented out two choppers and two cruiser bikes and we had a super fun time riding around the beach biking path! You can bike to the marketplace and check out their clothes, jewelry and food stands they have there as well. 

The chopper bikes are really really fun and I definitely recommend it if you are bored of your regular bike. It's much more comfortable since you are sitting down and pushing forward and it's really easy and fast.

I got napkins even and crammed into my ears and it was still so absolutely loud it was literally hurting my ears.

We had a little getaway vacation over Valentines weekend. We were greeted by very friendly staff who got us checked in quickly & efficiently. The hotel lobby smelled amazing & was very clean. 

Then we got to our room...

As soon as we walked in there was a blue plastic glove on the floor. Ok, maybe housekeeping dropped it while cleaning, not a big deal. As we were bringing in our suitcases, we notice more trash next to the bed, crumpled up tissue and paper. When my husband bent down to pick it up, he noticed ""nuggets"" under the bed. Looked like dog food or medicine? Which wouldn't be a problem except we have a dog ... who can't eat random things due to GI issues. Speaking of which, as the dog is running around smelling everything (as dogs do) he crawls under the dresser and comes out with a broken up chocolate medallion ... for anyone who doesn't know, chocolate is poisonous to dogs :( 
Also found the notepad and pen behind the dresser.

When staying at a hotel of this brand, we expect cleanliness at the next level, and attention to detail when finishing the room. This was disappointing. 

Again - the staff was AMAZING. Every single person we interacted with were so kind & helpful (which is SO HARD to find these days). Definitely the highlight of the trip!!",2021-02-16 02:41:12 UTC,3,0,0,0,m4vFlD-xbo-2pNymwZ6QVA

My husband and I had a reservation here for 3 nights and we were SO happy to leave after that. The initial room we were given had stool stains inside the toilet, lotion smeared from the previous guests on the bathroom walls, a man's beard hair trimmings in the sink and around the faucet, and lastly, coffee stains on the walls as well...gross! After flight delays and getting to NOLA 6 hours after we were supposed to, we were exhausted, understandably. We called the front desk, and told them that the bathroom was dirty and the manager, Floyd, moved us to a suite. We have to say that he was very kind and tried to make the situation better, which we appreciated. When we arrived at the suite, there was a ball of hair in the shower and food particles stuck between the edges of the coffee table (see attached pics). The hair ball was absolutely disgusting! Something you can't even unsee to be honest. We began to wonder if housekeeping even thoroughly cleans any of the rooms as this is one of Marriott's top tier hotels. Marriott Bonvoy states on their website that they ""deep clean between each customer"" when they checkout. We called again and spoke to Floyd and asked him to come see the condition of the suite for himself. He came to the room and said he'd switch us to another room, but we simply requested that the bathroom be cleaned in the initial room and that would suffice. He promptly sent someone to clean the bathroom, and they did. An hour after that, we realized that the A/C in our room wasn't working, and NOLA is super hot right now with temps in the upper 80s & 90s. We called the front desk AGAIN, and told the lady that we needed the A/C fixed and that we were not going to switch rooms again. She sent a maintenance man to look at the A/C, and when he arrived, he said he needed a code to check the system, which he didn't have. He also told us that he's about to get off of his shift and that he'd send someone else to look at it. No one came and we waited almost an hour! Finally, we called the front desk again and told the lady that no one from the oncoming shift has come to look at the unit. Mind you, this was way past midnight at this point and we were so tired that my husband said we should just go to sleep, but I said heck no, cause the room was SOOO hot! The second maintenance man came and was able to fix it and told us that the A/C definitely wasn't working. 
Floyd told us that he'd let the housekeeping manager know about the lack of cleanliness of the rooms and will request that she calls us to get more details. We were there to celebrate our anniversary, and for this reason, Floyd offered to provide an unspecified ""amenity"" for us. The operations manager, Chasity, did call and talk to my husband the next day in the afternoon. She stated that the reason why she called this late in the day is because she was personally supervising the housekeeper who had cleaned our room originally. She stated that she is very particular about how the rooms are cleaned and talked to the lady who cleaned our particular room as she was trying to determine what her method or strategy of cleaning was. She then offered to refund us 60,000 points for the first night, which has yet to be done (it has now been 3 days since we checked out, so we should have received the refunded points by now). We expressed to Chasity that we are very particular about having a clean bathroom whenever we stay at a hotel. She agreed and said that she understood. She went on to say that she used to be a travel associate for Marriott and her sole job was to inspect and check the cleanliness of these rooms. She stated that she had a particularly keen eye for details, especially the bedsheets. Later that day, we asked her if she could check on what amenity we'd be receiving that Floyd had told us about. She told us that it'd be food & beverage. Although she stated that it would be delivered at 5 pm on the last night, she mentioned that she'd expedite it to our room. After venturing out and coming back to our room, we noticed that we were given a $12 bottle of champagne with 3 chocolate covered strawberries. We were a bit shocked since we had been through so many issues during this stay. We were looking so forward to staying here and having our first ""Ritz experience,"" but that wasn't the case as it was very disappointing. We would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone. Save your money and stay at a Residence Inn or Courtyard by Marriott property that will be MUCH cleaner than this place. There's also a severe lack of communication between the staff and management here. The hotel building itself is very old and that is incredibly evident. Lastly, we only expected to receive exactly what we paid for.",2021-06-13 02:21:55 UTC,1,1,4,5,fHdatEEGHbxcCLWgAM95Bg

Customer service here is one of the many things that put this Ritz location in New Orleans to another level.

On a recent travels I decided to stop off in New Orleans for a little respite on my drive. The location of the Ritz is great and being right on Canal St you are within walking distance of almost anything that you can think of if you are looking for some good food and good times. Actually both can be found in the same places depending on your vices. If walking is not your thing plenty of public transit options. The staff was very friendly and was helpful especially since I got there close to midnight. Usually there is a drop off and you get the barely B team working at nights but not on this occasion. What I found most impressive is that the attendant at front desk told me of my benefits I had without even asking.

The building itself has been there since 1897 but you would never know with the upkeep. The room was very clean (I would hope so) and despite covid precautions they cleaned the rooms every day. This was one of those rooms that was so relaxing to the point that if you decided to stay in bed all day and not leave your room I would not blame you. Plenty of selections from the onsite restaurant and the bar is pretty good with real mixologist that can quench that thirst for almost any adult libation.",2022-01-02 21:36:48 UTC,4,2,0,2,jOkW0penAbTG-D9C_9nE7g

As much as I wanted to absolutely love my experience, I was sadly disappointed and let down. 

I dined alone, making my reservation for the 2:30pm seating. I was sat a lovely pre-set table for me. The restaurant and bar was mostly empty and I was sat right next to a couple of ladies holding a business meeting / job interview so I got to listen to their conversation the whole time. Why did you do that to me? If you saw this lady sit down who regularly holds business meetings at this location, yes she was a regular as many employees stopped by to say hi to her, why didn't they move my pre-set table to another table so I didn't have to be in the middle of it. I did not like listening to their conversation nor did I like to hear the interviewee saying ""Cool"" in response to her interviewer every other five seconds. Ugh. I came very close to telling her how annoying she was. 

Service was excellent tho. I wasn't quite sure what type of tea I would be interested in so the server suggested a mix of two that he liked and it really was perfect... I drank the whole pot of tea! I would have had another if it was offered to me. 

I also was expecting more to my high tea... I didn't realize it included petite samples... not small quarter sandwiches, they were literally bite sized. Same with the scones / muffins, as well as the sweets but that was ok actually since there were several choices.

They also Have towel ""vending machines "" that did not work and this was the only place you could get pool or beach towels. 
Also beware of booking online we got charged resort fees through the booking company and also the hotel!",2021-02-20 19:51:43 UTC,3,0,0,0,XvMDF_f_1XqXAqZ7GR2UVw

Front desk concierge told us check out was at 11am and they would do their best to accommodate an early check in. 

We decided to go sit on the beach and wait for our room. By 10:30 on Friday they were out of beach loungers. The $40 resort fee covers 2 loungers per room but they are first come first served. If you're not there before 10am on the weekend you're not getting a lounger or an umbrella (which is an additional $20) or a cabana (which is $60) 

By 4pm we still weren't in a room. We went to the front desk and our room was still not ready. We were given a drink voucher for 2 drinks and told we were 3rd in line to get our room. 

We waived daily housekeeping for a $15 food and drink credit which has to be used each day or you lose it. 

We eventually got into our room at 630 and I went to take a shower where I was met with cockroaches. I didn't need another drink voucher (which is how the seem to solve every problem at this resort) so I killed the roaches and took a shower. 

The shower does not hold water temperature. It goes from hot to cold, hot to cold. Similarly the air conditioner does not hold temperature. The room goes from hot to cold while you're sleeping. The floors in the room are disgusting. My feet were black just from walking from the bed to the bathroom. 

One of the staff told us it's a ""party resort"" and it's mostly true. You'll smell weed all day everyday during the weekend. Not sure if it's a place you want to bring your kids. 

Some rooms come with a full size fridge and some with a mini fridge. 2 people that came with our group had their fridge go out during their stay.

First of all do not have a wedding here. We paid for an extra hour of extended bar and the staff wasn't aware because they forgot to tell them  so the bartender threw the paper in the brides face and kicked everyone out an hour early forcing us to the rum runners bar where we had to pay for drinks for 30 people that had already been paid for by extending.  The king suite oceanfront room is not a gulf front room you pay for a gulf view you are in the back of the hotel. They gave 1 of the bridal parties rooms away completely and they were booked 6 months in advance. They do not help with anything ironing of chair covers setting up centerpieces decorating the awning. It is over priced for the service you get. Go to Clearwater and stay at the Westin or one of the upper scale hotels where you get what you pay for. The only reason for the 2 stars was the food was very good. Compass grill has excellent food. Brandon at Rum Runners is amazing and gives you the best service. Everything else was awful. We ordered room service for the day of the wedding for bridal party 2 hours later no food and I was hung up on by every ext I was transferred to.

Sure the hotel is a little out dated but definitely wasn't bad. Our room was partially updated and with the limited amount of time we spent in the room it was just fine. Majority of what I saw around the property was updated too. 

The staff was always very welcoming and I appreciate their text message software checking in on us throughout the stay. Audrey, Scott and Eddie at the compass grille were always great for our meals. Dominique and Carol at Rum Runners always kept the drinks flowing all day for us. 

The pools get super packed so set your stuff out at breakfast and save your spot for mid morning or you'll probably not going to get a spot at the pool. They have tons of beach chairs that are free and the umbrella rental is only $20 bucks a day. We would leave our stuff in the beach chairs and go up for lunch and return. 

All in all, we had a great experience and would definitely come back.  

My only thing for management to do would be check out the play ground area. A couple of the steps on the ladder are rusting and it's just a matter of time before a kid puts their foot on it and gets hurt. You'll see it when you go look at it.

My 2 sisters and I had very high expectations for this resort. We were only going to stay one night but changed it to you because we were so excited. When we first checked in, and got wristbands for the beach chairs and resort. Our room was on the 7th floor facing the street, which was fine. At night you heard lots of noise but we were in a corner room. The bedroom and bathroom were very small. The tub had a big brown stain on it, and there was hair all over the bathroom floor & door. We ignored it because we were still excited. That night we went to the pool and bar by Harry's and was sad that the fire pit wasn't open. That was fine though! we headed to the beach and just enjoyed the day. The next day we got up, and ate breakfast by the beach. We went to the pool by Harry's to order lunch and have a drink. we ordered and sat by the pool. A few minutes go by and I get a creepy vibe from a guy staring at us. I tried to ignore it but couldn't. I finally told me and my sisters we need to leave. We went to the bartender Nate (who was AWESOME BTW) and he said your good will be out shortly. Sure enough the creepy guy followed up. We felt VERY uncomfortable so we went to the rum runners restaurant. We walked up to a staff member and said hey we ordered from Harry's but can you have them delivery it here ?and he said no you have to get it, and I said ok but we're going to stay here. Again he said no you need to get it since you ordered if. I finally said sir, a random guy is making up feel very uncomfortable and we do no want to walk back over there. He said we'll I guess I can call. He called and said yeah my chef isn't answering so you have to walk over there to grab it. So my sisters and I walked by over to Harry's very cautious, but we didn't see the creepy guy. We asked Nate the bartender if he saw the guy go somewhere and he said I called security and kicked his ass out. Lol (the creepy guy also did not have a wrist band). We told Nate our experience and he was very understanding and said that we should have told him sooner about the situation. We appreciated that he noticed that we felt uncomfortable. We also did not like how anyone can just walk in and use the pool / beach. There is not security at the front gate and it's very open to the public. We most likely will not stay here again, as 3 young woman we did not feel safe. We also wish we just stayed one night instead of two.",2022-01-15 01:34:18 UTC,1,0,0,0,CGv62sAdET5AEKqCKPy-SQ

So I booked this hotel for my mans birthday, when we checked in all the employees seemed to be friendly. The lady who checked me in moved our room from a ""bay"" view which isn't much of a bay due to blocking buildings, to a partial beach view. I appreciated it because the photos online were very deceiving. The room was nice and we went to the beach. From the bartenders, beach attendants to the custodians every staff member was amazing and friendly. 

This is where it takes a dark turn.
We went out to Hawl-O-scream and came back rather late. When we were going to unwind for bed, we went to plug in our firestick to watch our shows. We then noticed a camera blatantly on top sticking to the tv. Facing the bed. We were absolutely mortified. When we took the camera off, not only was it facing the bed but the chord directly went into the internet router. That seems extremely sketchy. We then went to the living room and found the exact same thing. A camera facing the couch. Needless to say I was completely freaking out. My fiancé and I contemplated the route we were going to go for hours, being completely mortified and feeling violated. We decided to TRY and sleep (which we could not) and address it to the hotel. We called the hotel lobby at approximately 4 am and asked who was the GM to speak to in the morning. They told us Paul would be in around 11. Granted check out was at 12. We waited for Paul to get in and my fiancé went to Go address our concerns. Not only was this man dismissive, he then pushed us out. His response was alarming. His response is that it was for the remote. We unplugged the device immediately and the remote worked just fine. It made absolutely no sense. No regard to how nerve racking finding a device in our private areas, and didn't even give an apology for how unraveling it can be. They said ""we have been thinking about putting post it notes to warn people"". We felt so uncomfortable and dismissed that we decided to file a police report. So we were not able to check out at the 12 o' clock time. We waited for the deputy to get there and at first they seemed concerned. They ordered them to open the room next door and see. After the GM and cop went behind closed doors abs spoke, the cops whole demeanor changed. The cop then dismissed us and didn't even come in our room to check! We asked for a case number to document the occurrence and again was dismissed. After this happened and feeling so violated and sketchy, it seemed to be a larger operation than anticipated since our concerns were being so dismissed. I called local attorneys. We then went to purchase another night to buy more time and do our own investigation to take the camera to an IT person. When we offered extend our stay, they refused us. They wouldn't even let us buy another night! If that doesn't scream GUILTY I don't know what does. Not only dismissing us, they wouldn't take our money and pushed us out when we were scared. They gave absolutely No comfort to the situation. Paul should not be running this establishment. After we finally got ahold of the police again and asked for a Sargent they then came up with a case number for us. As soon as we got the case number we left without any issues, left the place clean. I recommend you do not go to this place, especially with your children. You do not know what these creeps are really doing with those devices. The staff was amazing, but their conflict resolution skills are piss poor. If they gave us a reason and comforted us we would have probably even believed them. It was their reaction to our findings that was screaming sketchy business operations. I work in the travel industry and never in my life have I come across this issue and been so neglected of my concerns.

Stayed here Christmas Eve. This place is very run down. Nothing like the pictures. Their hot tub looked liked people been pissing in it for days without them cleaning it. Christmas Day I was woken up at 5 am to hearing the sound of water hitting my floor. When I get up to check it out my room had been flooded with toilet water that had been leaking from the ceiling all night that I had the joy of stepping in. I was very disgusted. I called the front desk, they send someone leaving the ceiling completely exposed and water continued to come down until I checked out. They guy said he would come back and never came back. Just left the room the way it was. They didn't even send in a cleaning person to clean up the mess. I had to use all the towels in the room to get the water away from the door so I didn't have to continue to step in it when I tried to leave. I wasn't able to use the bathrooms shower or pee because of this unsanitary conditions and was afraid to get human feces on me.  The management made things even worse by showing no compassion all they offered me was $30 which was 50% of the upgrade fee I paid to upgrade to that ocean view. I told them I didn't believe that was fair since I paid $60 to upgrade to that room on top of $300 what I already paid to stay plus their fees. They refused, saying  the 50% off the upgrade was the best they could do. The manager Mario is a disgraceful human being and should be ashamed by the way he treats people especially on Christmas! I had to go to my family's on Christmas without being able to get ready and look presentable for my family bc this establishment was not accommodating and very disrespectful. Shame on this place.

My new fiancé and I were there celebrating our engagement, all was well until it was time to move the pillows to lay down... there was BLOOD ON THE COMFORTER!!
Move the suitcase off of the other bed... there is BLOOD SPATTER on that comforter. 
(No. Neither of us were bleeding in any capacity.) 

I called the front desk, said they couldn't do anything... they were ""booked.""  I said ""well you don't expect us to sleep in here do you?!"" 
It was at that point someone dropped off ""clean sheets,"" and we were told that there would be a new room for us first thing in the morning.

They expected us, not only to sleep ON THE BEDS WITH THE BLOOD ON THEM, but to strip the beds, and put the new sheets on ourselves. 
We slept on the ""clean sheets"" on the FLOOR. 

I called in the morning to see when our new room would be ready. ""It's not ready yet, we're sending housekeeping right now."" Two hours later I had my fiancé call and ask if it was ready, they gave the same response. A total of 5 HOURS LATER we get a blanket text asking us how, on a scale from 1-10 our stay was. 
Obviously My fiancé said very unsatisfactory due to the blood, them not moving us that night, and STILL not having a new room ready for us. 
Amazingly when he said that they somehow had a new room available for us to move to immediately. They did give us a food and drink credit of $75 as a ""good will"" gesture. 
This hardly makes up for blood stained sheets and a complete lack of urgency in fixing the matter. 
I called and asked to speak to a manager about a refund of our first nights stay, to which I was told... ""My manager Paul will call you tomorrow (3.1.21)"" 
It is now 6:32 EST and I have YET to receive a call from Paul.

The bathroom floor has water under/trapped in so it squishes every time you walk, shampoo pumps in the shower are broken or missing, moldy towels... the list goes on. And for $300+ a night??! Now we know better, never again. 
On top of that, things were broken & poorly maintained in public areas as well. Fans, TVs, lights didn't work in rum runners & pavilions (we didn't go to Harry's). The pool ""closes"" at 10 but that is not enforced so we could hear people screaming from the pool in our room at all hours of the night.

During our stay, we encountered less than satisfactory service levels that I think you should know of and hopefully do something about.
First, when we entered the room we noticed a cigarette bud on the floor inside the room and additional cigarette buds on the balcony. First off I wasn't aware that smoking was permitted and secondly, I wonder what do the housecleaning people at your hotel do exactly to prepare the room for the next guest? We contacted the front desk and they offered to give us a credit and clean up the cigarettes buds, which we accepted because another room wasn't available yet for us to change rooms.
Second, we noticed the carpet floors on the forth floor were wet, but thought that the issue was being taken care of when we noticed maintenance addressing the issue. Well, a wet/dry vacuum and ""wet floor"" sign was the only action we saw being done. For four days and three nights we walked through wet carpet, it was disgusting and very unsanitary. I can't imagine why the maintenance and top hotel personnel wouldn't take a more serious approach to addressing the issue. Every day we thought to ourselves, they have to hire a company to professionally dry the carpet, and address any potential future mold concerns. Nothing was ever professionally done from Friday at check in until Monday at check out - nothing but a wet floor sign and maintenance staff with a we/dry vacuum.
At check out, I let the front desk staff know of our issues with the wet carpet floors and they said they were not aware of any leaks or wet floors on the forth floor which I strongly disagree. They offered to remove the $25 daily resort fee, we accepted it but it was a far less compensation than I would have anticipated.
I hope you agree with me that this type of service is completely unacceptable. It is not the kind of treatment I would have expected. I am very disappointed from this bitter experience.
I emailed the ""info@sirata.com"", no one replied. I then forwarded the same email to contacts I found on Sirata website. We were then contacted by a Michelle that said they already waived the $25/resort fee per day and that's all they were doing. She then said that they were unable to have a company come out for the leak because it was holiday weekend, which I find ironic that a water restoration company wouldn't be available during an emergency situation considering they promote they are open 24 hours a day. We walked through saturated carpet for 4 days and no professional company was ever seen! I hope Sirata knows that mold can spread in a little as 48-72 hours!

We were only staying here because of a wedding that I was in. Even with the room block wedding rate and the discounted resort fee our stay at this ""resort"" for two nights was $500. Now I would understand that pricing if this was a nice place, but for so many reasons it was not nice. First, the hotel/front desk is extremely hard to get a hold of, when someone eventually picks up the phone it is usually the wrong person, they end up transferring you and everyone sounds annoyed when you ask questions. This was how it was before my stay, during my stay when I called the front desk to get more towels because there was only two towels in the room, and after my stay when the charges on my card were incorrect, despite reviewing my bill at checkout. When we called the front desk from the room the phone just rang and rang and rang. No one ever picked up. The ""resort"" reminds me of a budget inn on the beach. The buildings are old! The insides of the rooms have had a face lift, but you can tell they are old by the yellowed light switch plates and the plumbing. The toilet in our room would barely flush and the water pressure was extremely light. The water temperature would go from cold to scalding in a second though. We went to turn on our TV and the first night and it wouldn't work, they had to send someone out to fix it they eventually did come. I had finally gotten to bed, when all the sudden this box that I thought was correlated with the AC beeped and began brightly flashing. It flashed all night, I couldn't shut it off or restart it. I later learned from friends that were staying that that is a dehumidifier and you have to empty it yourself. It would have been nice to have been told that by someone. The pools were cloudy which is concerning. And lastly the restaurants are subpar. We ordered peel and eat shrimp and it took almost an hour just to get the shrimp. When we got them the cocktail sauce was as if it had come out of the freezer and was the consistency of a slushy. The server said that is just how it is served. We asked for more clarified butter and the server said sure but it might take just as long as the shrimp did. I could not believe it so I just said ok. The only notable service we received was from LaFreida at the gate she was kind and actually took the time to answer my questions. I will also say our room was very close to the beach which is the only reason they got two stars. They also had really nice hammocks for use on the beach. If you have more than one car for your room you also have to pay $15 per night and parking is a hot commodity after hours so if you come back to the hotel late plan on parking far away from your room. Overall, if you are looking for a nice resort, keep looking. I think the place would be fine if the price was cheaper but the value of what your getting is not worth the money.",2021-06-17 02:37:32 UTC,2,0,0,1,sywOZ8rI38GKCX6e0ij97g

I can say with upmost confidence we will not return ever again. This resort is just not clean and that is my main priority when vacationing. We were given a room that was handicap accessible, upon entering the entire room had an overwhelming odor of chlorine(gross). The bathroom is all tile like a YMCA bathroom. While they told us it was handicap accessible, this isn't what I had imagined. Walls in the room are full of chips and red stains.... 

They moved us to a different room which then reeked of cigarette smoke..we couldn't win. 

Pool was extremely over crowded with kids. I don't think I'd have so much of an issue with this place if they charge 150$/night. But for $300 a night this is unacceptable.

PROs: Friendly staff, good location (many places to eat around), Free transportation around the area, very local and not touristy area, clean room, balcony view was nice, restaurants on site are fairly priced (very shocked coming from Miami).

Cons: All in all, we had a good time. However I was bothered by a couple of things. And by no means am i being nit picky, just feel like you should know this before booking.

1. First, the parking spaces were very tight. There are a few that are a little more spacious but usually taken early. The rest 90% are very tight.
2. For the price that we paid (including $40+ daily resort fee(not sure why the heck its so high)) we expected a little more. First, you're not allowed to take coolers to the pool or beach. Second, they provide beach chairs but charge $10 for an umbrella. Whats the point of the resort fee if i have to pay more? They do however allow you to set up your own umbrella AWAY from the beach chairs area. Good thing we had ours.
3. Their website advertises these nice beach lounge tent kinda things. Turns out, they are for the hotel next door. Very deceiving.
4. The room. We paid a fairly pricey booking fee ($850-1200, not going to say exactly how much) for a 3 night stay. Although we did see the room online and can't say we were surprised, i feel like the room could've been better for the price we paid. The balcony view was nice and the room was clean. Can't complain about that. Just feel like we didn't get what we paid for there. But no complaints. Everything in the room worked.

All in all, we had a great time despite the rain. However, I did take away one lesson. Resorts in FL for the most part are so not worth it. For about $300 more we could have booked an ALL INCLUSIVE (flight included) resort outside of the country for more than just 3 days. At the end of the day, these places are businesses and prioritize profit over customer experience. Might as well get the most for what you pay for. 

I would like to visit again but next time booking the cheapest room they have.",2021-09-23 14:30:04 UTC,3,0,0,0,yiCjJOd64hmNye0J0UHDpw

And I am very glad it did! We came here for lunch, there is seating outdoors, some indoors with more space on the second floor. Given that it was a nice fall day, we sat outside. 

Of course I decided to start my meal with a flight. The menu is nicely organized to highlight what is popular. The flight brings 5 beers of your choice from the menu. I got a nice variety of blondes, fruity IPA, and darker beers and was not disappointed by any of them. Safe to say all their beers are pleasers! 

I had to listen to my google search and ordered the Nashville Hot Chicken sandwich and it was out of this world. The chicken was a nice thick portion, perfectly crispy topped with pickles and jalapeños. So so savory. I also ordered the PBLT, which was so decadent. The pork belly was tender and juicy and easy to bite into. Both dishes were served with the most crispiest shoe string fries I've ever had so I think it is up to the eater on the preference of fries. I like crispy fries so I enjoyed it, however my boyfriend likes more potato - so really depends on you. Overall, everything was delicious.

I typically order hot from Hattie B's, for example, and the hot here was right around that level of heat.  The housemade pickles on the sandwich were especially tasty.  We got the garden salad as our side (subbed for the fries), and it was great as well.  The State Park Blonde ranch dressing took it over the top - best ranch dressing I've ever had!  We got the fish tacos for an app and were pleased with those as well, though I don't know if we'd necessarily order them again (very good, just not knock your socks off).

We came in and sat at the small bar at first and waited around for almost 10 minutes without any service, which was fine we were not upset about that, but while waiting we saw a table open up and we went and sat at it. Around 15 minutes later we got a server. We ordered flights of beer but was told that they have temporarily stopped flights because they are so busy. Looking around and I see two other tables open downstairs, I can only see four tables upstairs, but three of those are open and there's absolutely not a single person sitting outside. They looked like they're about 60% full here so I don't really understand how at 60% full you're too busy to do a flight. Plus you're a brewery, tasting different beers and flights are kind of the point.

Anyways we said we would need a few more minutes and then when the server came back the next time he said he had talked to someone and that they would let us do a flight.

They have an outdoor patio, an upstairs, and seating in their brewing area. Many of the people who were there were eating, so I'd recommend trying their food as well as their beer. It seemed like there was an even mix of visitors and regulars, which surprised me for a weekend. 

We asked to sit at the last table available downstairs and someone came by five minutes later to ask if we wanted water and what we'd like to order. About fifteen minutes later, I went up to the bar to see if I was confused and needed to pick it up when I saw our waitress coming down from upstairs with our beers. The service is good in that everyone is friendly, but everything takes some time so I wouldn't recommend coming here if you were stopping in for a quick bite or drink as there was a consistent 10-15 minute wait between asking and receiving drinks. 

My husband and I tried the State Park Blonde, which was accurately described as light and crisp, the Southern Wit which was so yummy, and the Wildwood Flower, which was my favorite due to its unique sweet flavor.

I also tried the Colt's double-chocolate raspberry stout for dessert and that was heavenly. Great raspberry flavor with the richness of dark chocolate and really great full body too. 
The falafel was absolutely delicious! Nice crunchy exterior and full of flavor. The hopped lebnah yogurt sauce also really went well with and enhanced the flavor of the falafel. I would definitely want these again the next time we go! 
I also thoroughly enjoyed the 5-beer burger. Amazing variety of perfectly matched flavors and great textures as well! The fries were nice and crispy, very well seasoned and we both loved the unique ketchup--my husband even wanted to bring a bottle home! Unfortunately they don't sell it by the bottle at the moment though. 
Our absolute only disappointment was the Nashville hot chicken sandwich. It was fine, but not as good as either of us hoped. It seemed like the breading was more spicy just to be spicy and just kind of smoky. Not especially salty or savory or any other kind of flavor along with it.

The guy told me that if I wanted drinks I could order from him but if I wanted food then I just needed to wait and a server would come by. It was not very busy and multiple servers just walked past us. 
Overall, the food was so good. I'd recommend the Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich.",2021-06-27 17:57:12 UTC,4,0,0,0,VDRw6ua18GK7gRXsSVBKug

Cool vibe as you walk up the steps to the place. A few people seated outside - happened to not be too cold out - as we walked in you are in a small merch area that has shirts, hats, pint glasses and some of the drafts packaged and ready to go. 

As we walked around the corner our server told us to grab a seat anywhere and we got to hear the last song and a half that the musical guest performed (really good!). 

Our server was quick to get to us and they did have a full dine in eating menu, but we just got a beer and sat and relaxed for a few minutes. I chose the colts bolts: 

Inspired by the original Colts Bolts chocolate by the Colts Chocolate Company and at 10% Alcohol by Volume, the Colts Bolts Imperial Pastry Stout showcases the same qualities as the original chocolate candy. We brew this beer with real peanut butter, almonds and chocolate - all natural ingredients - which is how all the beer is brewed by Tennessee Brew Works. Really liked this stout and I'd give it a 5 out of 5.

My wife got one of the ciders they had (came in a bottle or can), but they served it to her in a glass. She was happy with her selection. 

Prices were reasonable and staff were great. We both agreed, if we lived in the area we'd come back more often. Highly recommend!",2021-02-05 21:49:22 UTC,5,4,1,5,NrwOmR6t6XAkHMkxbJc1tA

I got a flight of 5 beers for $15, all of which were delicious. By far the highlight for me was the Baja Fish Tacos. I'm from Florida and these were quite possibly some of the best fish tacos I've ever had!! Service was great, our server Amanda was really sweet.

Grilled medium and juicy, great come-back sauce, thick sliced bacon, melted cheese, a croissant like bun with salt crystals on top, perfectly cooked shoestring fries on the side, a hummus appetizer that was spot on. 
Maybe it's because I haven't eaten out much at all since COVID and this early warm spring day with 2 beers in me made it taste that damn good as I sat out on the patio but it was TREMENDOUS. My wife did the veggie pattie and said even that was one of the best burgers she's ever had.

Finally now 9 months later and after moving my oldest daughter here with her husband and deciding to move her ourselves come June of 2021 we stopped in to try it for ourselves while in town checking on the progress of our new home build. So here we go:

Ambiance:
Rustic / brewery feel. Should be this way right it's a brewery / ample tables set up outside (as it was a beautiful day) and 2 floors inside. Bit of a ""cafeteria feel"" upstairs where you can view the brewing floor. Not super comfortable but again brewery so it screams we brew beer not we cater to your tush!

Service: 
after giving him a hard time about not carding me (I look younger though) but carding my son on law (who looks 19 - lol and is close at 23...he did a descent job of taking our orders and checking up on us.

Food: 
Food was good, gotta be honest nothing write home about - but the burgers were done well and the grilled cheese had goat cheese which made it sweet and tangy for a different slant on the old traditional sandwich. Fries had a good spice on them as well so for bar food (gotta lump it in with that) it was better than normal just not your gastopub quality or feel.

Price:
Overall slightly more expensive than your average brewery prices but not overly expensive. Flight of beer was $13 and burger was $15 so like I said about $2-3 over normal. 

Overall: 
Give it a go if you like their beer - because honestly that's what your here for. If you could stop in for an appetizer and a few beers before heading to dinner somewhere where the ambiance and vibe will be a lot more festive and tasty - then that's what I think would be best for this place.

We ordered a couple of beers and they were good. I had the blond recommended and it was great. My husband said the IPA was good 

We ordered a cesar salad with Nashville chicken to share and the salad was delicious. A more flavorful take on the original- even the croutons were next level delicious. 
Our server recommended the burgers as the most popular item and they were out of this world. The fries are seasoned and so fantastic as well. I'm not a meat eater and my husband is and we both loved them. 
The service is slow sometimes- like if you want extra water or need anything else but it's friendly so still five stars. 
They charge you with a machine at the table and the bill suggests a tip- but you can edit- making it easier for those who don't enjoy the math at the end. 

Some points to note- no deserts here and street parking in front. We came Thursday night but I could see it get crazy on the weekend.",2021-10-28 00:18:38 UTC,5,0,0,1,N2X9s6DliMWZAdbt0qbc5w

It's great to see these efforts and are very much appreciated.**

We were really hoping to enjoy this spot and left disappointed. 
We stopped by here on a short weekend trip to Nashville last weekend. We wanted to avoid the main downtown strip and loved that this location was a little more quiet. We got lucky with parking right across the street when we visited on a Saturday night. 

What originally drew us to this spot was the dog-friendly patio and beer selection. There were so many beers my husband and I each wanted to try, unfortunately we weren't given the opportunity. 

When we walked in we looked for a host or direction on where to sit. The host was a tall young lady with brownish hair (didn't get her name) that welcomed us with a ""there's no seating inside."" Because the bar and seats were full inside with plenty of wait staff, we found this confusing and were waiting for her direction on where we could sit. We then had to ask, can we sit in any open seat out here? She said, ""yes if you can find one."" Okay great, we found a spot and looked up the menu right away to figure out what we wanted to order.

Twenty minutes+ went by and she hadn't visited our table. Had she stopped by and mentioned she was unbelievably busy, to take a peek at the menu, and she would be back, we would have been 1000% understanding. I ended up finding her inside talking to someone so I patiently waited for her to finish and then asked how we can order food and some beer. She responded with, ""I'll come to you when I can"" with an attitude unfortunately that caught me off guard. She seemed proud of the way she said that and I thought it was very unprofessional.

My husband and I were being as patient as we possibly could for service but with that type of response, we thought it wasn't worth the wait any longer. I worked in the restaurant industry and do understand busy days and stressful hours. By the look of other empty seats around us, it was hard to rationalize why we weren't able to have the opportunity to try the menu and beer here. Sorry to your team for the low review but it takes the same amount of effort to be kind than the way she treated us. We wished for a different experience and hope others have a better one than we did.",2021-06-04 20:30:37 UTC,3,10,4,11,VdQzm498-vEuqjMO4GkdEg

Sat at the top of the stairs outside right behind the band setup inside. The music was a relief after spending the last few days in downtown on Broadway, smooth jams played which matched the vibe of this place. It was absolutely beautiful outside, 70 degrees.

Half my group left to go potty and get us drinks and the other half waited. All of the sudden our group leader was like okay let's go. Even though half our group wasn't even there. She didn't even care to wait 5 minutes. She seemed annoyed to be working and basically when the tour started it was like an auto play started to come out of her mouth. My group ended up meeting us at the first stop but it was a chaotic start to the tour. The tour was about 2 hours so you definitely get your money's worth.

The mysterious man in the Tales from Darkside shirt. I gave him Tip. He deserved 100 bucks or more. I love people who love their community and their town and are interested in its history and like to tell other people about it since all of us Americans New Orleans is our home as well as where we come from throughout the United States I am originally a native Bostonian but I'm also glad to call New Orleans my home.

The experience started a little rough when the group was clearly asked to arrive 30 minutes early under expectation that the tour departs on time instead of waiting for late guests, however when we arrived 30 minutes early we ended up waiting another 15 minutes for a few late parties.  While I didn't want to feel rushed necessarily, this tour is during evening hours and many groups will have dinner reservations following their tour, so a prompt departure should be honored.  Also our group was nearly 20 people which made it a little difficult to distance despite booking during COVID; I was hoping the company would have limited their groups to smaller numbers to better adhere to distancing guidelines and for the comfort of their guests.  Unfortunately due to the size of our group, it made it very hard to hear our tour guide (a small waist speaker pac like some other tour groups would have been so helpful), and many times loud vehicles would pass by and the guide would attempt to keep talking over the noise instead of waiting for the noise to pass, so we missed much of the stories.

My guide said he hates when people write reviews and say not scary enough, um.. maybe they're right? And PS - This is Bourbon St! I asked at the beginning of the tour, are we going to stop and get libations? Yes I'm told. We didn't stop at all which also sucked. 

The tour starts off with a guy who was heartbroken and jumped to his death. Like VH sang, go ahead and jump? Did the guy get up afterwards? Not scary.

Then we're shown where the axe man lives. He was part of the black hand, what they call the Italian Mafia. He used an axe on people. Lordy! Why did these people get the axe in the first place? Maybe they were too deep into the Shylock and kept skippin on their payments? Billy Batz's has a cousin in New Orleans. Not scary.

Now it starts to get interesting. New Orleans it seems has an actual vampire community. These folks drink human blood to get their kicks. Guess what fangers? I'm AB+, the tastiest blood I'm told. They had a bar, why didn't we stop and drink? I could have flirted with those vamp bitches, told them my name is Billy AB.

Now onto the juicy stuff. There's a French Church in town. A mysterious ship comes 
Into port. Slowly, people begin to disappear off Bourbon St. Story has it, the church has a third floor. One of the locals decides to check the church and finds a bunch of coffins?! He opens a coffin and sees a vampire sleeping. He closes the coffin and quietly escapes. The next morning he comes back and nails the shutters and doors with holy nails? Me, I would have killed those vamps. Years later in the early 70s, some local said, why are the shutters all closed? There ain't no such thing as vampires. Schmuck! He opened the shutters and those Vamps drained him. The townsfolk found that man sucked dry. Sure would have been nice to hear that story with a libation!

They touched on New Orleans VooDoo but now there is HooDoo? What type of Bullshit is happening? There can't be HooDoo without VooDoo?? The guide had different colored packets of ""something"" to ward off the bad luck. He said there was a guy who drives around fast and revs his Dodge which interrupts his tour. Um... hi? I'm Bill S, Yelper and Hemi driver. That cat sounds like a hero to me! 

What the tour guide did explain how Andrew Jackson (the guy on the 20 dollar bill) DOUBLE flanked the British when they were coming to New Orleans. We lost about 200 Heroes in that battle. The British lost over 1000! Are there any Red Coat ghost sightings on Bourbon St? And ghost ships in the harbor? Nice fact to
point out, still thirsty! 

I've been on a nightly ghost tour in Charleston, scary! This tour, I know New Orleans has a scary past, somehow the tour guide didn't get us scared. Or buzzed.",2021-10-07 12:11:10 UTC,2,10,8,15,8aqy02F-_xDvgoqeXhmx_g

Took this tour with my better half for a birthday present in late December. It was a little colder when we went but it gave for a ""chilly spooky vibe."" Please note that this is a historical tour and is not a haunted ""amusement"" attraction/tour. No one is going to pop out at you, try and scare you, etc. Now I'm a BIG horror fan and love haunted amusement attractions as much as the next person but this ain't it. Just some good ole, down to earth, FUN people telling popular ghost stories in the French Quarter. Our tour guide was Christina and she was a blast! Spoke loudly enough and even tweaked our bathroom break to accommodate for an earlier stop! Definitely a tour to take if you haven't done so but again, please do expect this is a haunted attraction/amusement park experience. Be prepared to walk, admire the architecture, crack a few jokes, meet others and have a few drinks all while listening to some fabulous locals tell tales.

used profanity and voiced his personal political views, which I do not see how calling Andrew Jackson our 7th president a racist misogynist and then challenging anyone in the group to argue with him has to do with ghosts.

We chose this place for a quick ""rocket trip"" - a 24 hour little staycation while our kiddo was at Auntie's house. We opted for the Club Level upgrade - an small extra fee that included happy hour drinks and apps, as well as a complimentary continental breakfast. I HIGHLY recommend splurging for this upgrade! While the breakfast and hor d'ourves were minimal because of COVID restrictions, we still enjoyed our complimentary wine in this awesome quiet little lounge and were very impressed that the service that came with it!

Our room included cozy robes and slippers, as well as an outstanding view of downtown Reno. What a sight once the sun went down! The King bed was HUGE and quite comfy! The room itself was quite spacious as well.. An added bonus was the proximity to their own awesome restaurant, Cafe Whitney, and the food there is KILLER!! (That review is separate!)

So the thing that puts this hotel in a league of its own are the small touches - a phone # to text if we need anything, Drake on the ""do not disturb"" sign (haha), a filtered water dispenser, the dog-friendly atmosphere.

Walking around at night is okay for adults, but if you are traveling with kids (even teenagers) you may want to stay at a hotel closer to the convention center.  That area is much nicer.  

The most disappointing part of staying at the Whitney Peak is that the restaurant and bar closed early.  There are a handful of good restaurant options nearby, but you have to be comfortable walking in a sketchy neighborhood to get to them.  If you are from a city environment, it probably won't bother you.  However, if you are used to a safe suburban environment, you will most likely not be comfortable walking around after dark.

On the positive side, it was clean. The rooms are decent size and have amenities for business travelers.  Several people in my party enjoyed the breakfast at the restaurant.  The hotel has a dry and wet sauna. So you get slippers and a plush robe in your room. And there is a cool rock climbing wall on the outside of the hotel that goes all the way to the top. The hotel is right next to the Welcome to Reno sign and the river for some good photo ops.

Single night.  Older guests, one on crutches.  Entry pretty rough:  no doorman/bellhop, no automatic doors.  So we were on our own with luggage until we asked for and got help from a kind car valet person.  Check-in fine.  Room design creative, inspiring even.  We requested and were assigned a disability-access room.  But there was still a tub (not a walk or roll-in shower) so that didn't really work.

Bed was very disappointing.  Felt flimsy:  when you sat on the edge it felt like the edge of wire springs on the back of your legs.  Bed linens were also subpar, and the pillows were embarrassingly flat.

However, our biggest issue with the room was the HVAC system.  After a long drive we were very ready for a solid, quiet rest.  But we were surprised at how cold the room was - 63 degrees.  We reset the thermostat to 'auto', and the temp to 72, but it didn't warm the room quickly.  By the time we woke up it was warmer - but only to 65.

No ice in the ice machine

Toilet paper was so cheap and stiff, that it felt like using parchment paper

The hallways are oddly illuminated with red lights
The outlets located on the nightstand lights were either weird sizes or worn. Charging block didn't fit. It bounced back and forth being too small and couldn't charge. Had to locate a wall outlet
The vents smelled like dust or mold. Same smell you get when you haven't used your hvac for several months then turn it on (musky smell)

When we told them they said we were wrong, and that we did infact book for 2 nights.  They told us that we were charged for two separate nights, and when we finally told them we called to ASK how much two nights were but never booked because it was too expensive, they backed up and said the charge should fall off, and that we won't be charged anything additional.

Its been a week and both charges just posted, and when we called they said it should be refunded in 5 days. It should've never been there to begin with and now we have to wait to get our money back. We could barely enjoy our time at Reno because this hotel took almost $1000 from us.

We checked in late last night after a long drive.  I was really impressed when we entered the lobby. Very chic and the smell smelt wonderful.

After getting the key to room the only thing I wanted to do was sleep. I did a quick disinfecting  the entire room, wiped down all the handles and jumped in the bed. 

I naturally woke up at 7 with heavy eyes, realizing we had a 11am check out. I called front desk and asked Cassidy for a late checkout. In a snotty tone he obliged and said he can do 12. I kindly asked ""Can we do 1pm? He was repl9y ""I'm happy to do 12."". Me being so tired asking ""Can we do 12:30?  Cassidy again in his snotty tone ""I'm happy to do 12."" At this point I get it. I get up to use the restroom and now that it's daylight I begin to analyze the room and it's absolutely disgusting.

Please see the my pictures for proof. 

This room was not cleaned. I'm convinced. Absolutely disgusting. With that being said, I didn't need the extra hour to sleep in. I checked out 2 hours earlier.

Housekeeping Management should really double check to make sure the rooms are clean, especially during Covid.

I chose this hotel because I had been in Reno a few weeks earlier and stayed at the El Dorado which is dark and dreary. This hotel is lighter and brighter and no casino. Perfect!  Yeah, not so much. There is something really wrong with the air conditioning in this hotel. When I opened the door to my room and the blackout drapes were closed, I should have known. I also should have known when I noticed that the cleaning staff had them closed in the rooms they were cleaning. I opened the drapes and the temperature immediately went up. So naturally I turned the air on. I had the fan on high at 50 degrees the whole time and slept uncovered and was sweating the whole time I was there. I could only open the drapes after the sun went down. It's difficult to get ready in the morning when you're hot. And where did they get the mattresses from?  The 1980's?  When I sat down, the back of my legs got hit by what felt like wood and the bed creaks and makes so much noise!  My first thought was, did I just sit down on a box spring?  I ran my hands along the side of the bed and could feel the springs. I now have pain my shoulder that I have never had before. Also, the sheets don't cover the whole bed.....they literally short sheet the bed.  The elevator that everyone says has been down since March, is still not working. This hotel is busy and stopping at every floor and people cramming into an elevator during Covid because there aren't enough elevators is not cool. Having to wait in line to get on an elevator is not so fun either. Especially when you are 10 groups back. Also, check your invoices after you stay and make sure they charged you correctly. They corrected the overcharge, but if I wasn't expensing this through my work, I might not have noticed.  Don't bother with the ""gift shop"" it's in the gym and doesn't have anything to offer. There's more, but I hit the major points. I should have stayed at the El Dorado, dark and dreary, but the beds are nice, the rooms are a good size, the air works, and they have a gift shop to by water and basic snacks if you want . I travel a lot for work and this was the worst experience I have ever had in 4 years.

Who knows, since everyone does that now.  Everything was broken!  The elevators take forever to work since the middle one is out of service.  We waited up to 40 minutes to get it. We heard that it won't be fixed for a very long time.  As others have said, the air conditioning in the rooms is horrible.  It doesn't read right for the room temp and never reaches what you've set it at.  The gym is a joke.  One bike is broken and the other one is also but doesn't have a sign on it.  The seat doesn't stay locked in, making it useless.  There's only 2 bikes. When we arrived, we noticed that someone had set our safe, but it was open, so we couldn't shut it to set it.  We called and the ""engineer"" came and literally yelled at my husband saying it was all our fault and we didn't know what we were doing. He didn't fix it and we had to call him back and he started yelling all over again.  When I told the front desk in person,  they asked me his name and I said I didn't know, but she could look up our room number...funny, that she didn't even bother to ask me our room number!!  Also, the chair in our room was broken and housekeeping on the weekend was horrible.

The Staff in the concierge room and the front desk are really welcoming and helpful. 

Now the bad.  We arrived when it was over 100 degrees in Reno.  While they did a presentable job on the upgrades on the interior, they neglected the infrastructure. The Air Conditioner was set at 50, and it failed miserably. Since the thermostat was just under where the lukewarm air was blowing, it thought it was 67 in the room, but felt more like mid-70s the entire four days we were there. 

The shower was good, but the water didn't drain properly. I wasn't in that long and when I got out, the water had filled the bathtub 3/4 of the way. 

There are three elevators in this hotel. two work, one is being retro-fitted. It was a running joke with the staff, because it's been down since March.  There was always a line to ride the elevator, the stairs were not possible because of alarms.

The telephones in the room had buttons with things like, front desk (which takes you to the main recording)  Housekeeping (sends you to the Valet), etc. 

Maid service was a joke.  Every day they wouldn't come until after five.  We requested an early turnaround each day and each day they came later.  When we complained, the maid did not put a top sheet on the bed. For some reason they would give us three towels and only one wash cloth.

For the cost of a standard room you get some extra touches here and there in the lobby bar and restaurant. On this visit I decided to book the only two rooms left last minute on a rod trip back from Colorado. I went for the club level room on the 16th floor. ( top floor ) I expected A lot more than what I got when I walked into my $300 a night room. Carpets need to be cleaned and or replaced, outdated bathroom which is small and a bit dirty. The mattress in the room was no bueno. Almost like it was an afterthought. The sheets were also a bit starchy and scratchy. Come on Peaks, invest in your guests sleeping comfort! 
I do have a few positives, the large ceiling to floor corner window is great, as is the fun green chair and light fixture above. 
Beware, I checked in at around 7 and the club lounge closes at 7. So, the extra that I paid for I didn't even get to use. No snacks, drinks. Walked into the lounge at 7:30 and not a soul in sight. 
Went to the front desk and inquired, the lady behind the desk finally offered me two drink tickets. I had mentioned I was disappointed I'd missed the free food and drink after such a long drive. 
For the money, go and book a regular room. I don't see any benefit to ever booking a club level again.

I called down for new iron and told them what happened and said I would need to hurry and go buy a shirt then need to come back and iron it. They promised a new iron was on the way and I would be receiving free breakfast for the problems. I got back with my new shirt and waited for the new iron. I called back down to the front desk they said he would be there right away. 30 minutes later he came to my room with 4 pillows for me. I was very confused by this but not nearly as the guy who brought me the pillows, who then said he would be right back with the iron and never came back.

Unfortunately it wasnt a great experience. The moment we arrived, we parked in front to unload our car. Valet asked if we needed valet or self park. We decided to self park. We were struggling to get all of our baggage from our car so we grabbed a rolling rack. The wind knocked it over and dented our car. Off to an awful start, right? Then the valet comes back and says he has to accompany us to our room due to covid and return the cart. Dude, we could've used help when we were unloading. We checked in quickly, with no explanation of where anything is (climbing gym, restaurant etc...) which was weird to me. Then our room was super basic. It had a Keurig but no coffee, no guides of any kind to the hotel or Reno, and a tiny window. We kept going to El Dorado the whole time for coffee and amenities. The only redeeming things were 1. The climbing gym and staff were awesome! 2. We ordered from the hotel restaurant and the food was delicious. Now, flash foward to us trying to leave. My husband waited for 20 minutes for an elevator to stop at our floor, so he could go grab our car. There were other people waiting too. I called to the front desk and explained we are taking the stairs. The stairs are alarmed and not for use unless there is an emergency. They said we could use them so we did and the alarm went off. We couldn't leave this cold, unfriendly establishment quick enough. I feel like I stayed at a motel 6.

The atmosphere was relaxed and we didn't feel rushed.

The food was outstanding! 

Bread basket: My GF loves bread so I knew that was going to be a part of our meal. The homemade bread with whipped butter was perfect. I only was allowed 1 piece. There was a variety of bread and we were able to bring a good portion home. 

Fish Tacos: The fish was seasoned and cooked to perfection. The slaw and the fish were a marriage made in heaven. You get two tacos with flavorful Cuban rice.

Short Ribs: Tender, tender, tender... No need for a knife. The garlic mashed potatoes and fresh spinach just enhanced the meal. 

Calamari: Flash Fried and lightly battered. I didn't like the Asain sauce that accompanied the calamari, however, it was still exceptional.

Plus two Tito's drinks and a soda.

The total: $95

Waiter was nice when we wanted to change our table from the middle to the side area. (Not a busy time). Waitress came over and gave us menus and took off. So much for drink orders. After a good 15 minutes I flagged her down and she  took our order. Oysters were terrific, rack of lamb was flavorful but my halibut was dry as dust despite a pineapple salsa. Plus the sautéed spinach was served raw. Scoop of basmati rice plain, nothing on it at all. Flavorless overall. Told the waitress to let the chef know and she was sympathetic. Still, a 30 dollar entree was like diner food. Conversely, my husbands meal was very good and flavorful. I think we'll give this place a big miss for awhile. Used to like the outside bar for a beer but that's also a no go. There are better places to eat in town for a better price and experience.",2021-07-23 22:10:45 UTC,3,0,0,1,W376grbGybM7x_bsNgzc-g

He really enjoyed it and he said it was really full of all the components and the broth was rich with just the right amount of spice. I tasted a spoonful of the broth and it really was rich and tasty. 

I ordered the French Dip Cheesesteak that had sliced Angus beef with grilled onions and cheddar cheese with a side of Au jus for dipping and some fries on the side. I really enjoyed the sandwich. It had a good amount of steak and just the right amount of onions and cheese and the beef broth was excellent for dipping. The fries were golden brown and crisp.

I said ideally needed more room to spread out my briefcase, paperwork, but no, need to move. I told him I bet $$ nobody sits at the 4-top. I moved regardless.

Now the lunch. My French onion soup was not French Onion soup...flavorless broth and unknown tasteless cheese. Caesar salad main course was the worst Caesar salad ever - there was zero Caesar salad dressing whatsoever - just some bland crap. My client ordered the shrimp/scallop special, which was especially NOT fresh!

We ordered takeout on a Saturday evening at 5:30. Ordering by phone, the first challenge is to figure out how to place an order, since the phone menu does not offer the option to place an order. You have to talk to table reservation to place an order.
When placing the order, the hostess seemed rushed, but it appears she got the order right. She took down my CC number and told me it would be 10-15 minutes. I should park outside and call when I get there- they will bring my food out to the car.
On my way to the restaurant they called me, because they screwed up taking down my CC number. I got that cleared up. When I got to the restaurant, I called and was told the food would be right out. I am sitting there for 20 minutes. Other customers go inside and come out with food-bags, so I decide to do the same.
It turns out my food had been ready for a while. It takes another 5 minutes to finally give it to me. I touched the food containers and they were cold. I complained about it and all I got was an apology. I finally had my food 45 minutes after placing the order.
Arriving home 5 minutes later, the food was mostly a disappointment. Everything was cold. The steak was over-cooked, tough and leathery. So was the Tuna. The appetizers were OK, at least the crab meat and the shrimp could be eaten cold. The rustic bread had gotten tough already.
So, two out of five. The staff needs training. They were not up to the challenge. And the food was mediocre. 

One afterthought and suggestion for management: I wanted to order online, but there is actually no tab to click for ordering online. Only a popup you get when you first open the webpage. I usually close popups without reading, so I never realized I could have ordered online. That is some sloppy web-design.",2021-02-28 00:20:07 UTC,2,0,0,0,1E-E1JcaeVO392FK8ttmOg

Well, the moment we were sat in a cramped tight corner of this place I knew we were doomed. 

I'm strictly giving 2 stars because we did enjoy the fresh oysters and our drinks, however the rest was less desirable. 

Our waiter did not seem interested in giving us adequate service. Bare minimum visits to the table (while having long drawn out conversations with the table behind us), never checking for re fills, silverware, taking dirty dishes away etc. So much so, the oysters that had ice under them completely melted by the time I was finally able to spot him and ask him to take them away. 

The worst part was when our French onion soup came up, he left the soup and was gone so fast before we realized there was no spoon. WE WAITED 22 MINUTES BEFORE WE SAW HIM AGAIN! By then the soup was cold and the whole rest of the night was off, by the time he came back out with the soup warm again we had gotten our meals, which my $40 crab cakes were also cold and served with the most bland couscous I've ever had. I asked for this to be re heated too, which they never really offered to fix. At a certain price point these types of things are inexcusable. I was actually charged twice on the receipt, odd, but fixed and still paid for the original plate that was terrible.

Waiter didn't know what Meyers steak was (as it is highlighted on your menu) and then proceeded to tell me it was better to her because it was tough and cooked and then told us how much she hated the filet because it tasted like ""animal"".  My fish and chips were gelatinous - inedible... mushy, soft... like something was wrong with it  and I still paid for it. Yes I told the waiter.

I will not be returning anytime soon, especially for how this place has held itself for so long. 
My waiter rudely interrupted my group's prayer before our meal and tapped one of my guests' arm to alert her of the coffee he had for her. Not only that, he slammed plates down once our food arrived, reached across two other guests' chests to slam another plate on the table, and took plates away prematurely. Everything felt rushed and we did not feel welcome.
Additionally, I ordered the Chicken Walnut Salad and my niece could have made something of much higher quality -- my salad only had two small walnut pieces! The dressing was not of what I would have expected a lunch special to be as well as the mere fact that the chicken looked to have been torn apart from a rotisserie chicken.

On the plus side it's located centrally and the inside is nice and romantic. the staff was reasonably attentive and friendly. However, Most of the things that we ordered were mediocre at best. While the lobster bisque Was very good, the Flatbread Appetizer was anything other than appetizing. The Fish tacos Reminded me of something that you can grab at a shopping mall Food Court. THe steak with a head of lettuce unceremoniously chopped in half with a blob of dressing on top reminded me more of The no frills Steak meal available at Arthur's. However at Arthur's you get a humongous steak, at The Lambertville Station you get A sliced Hockey puck. The ice cream dessert reminded me of something that you could pick up at Trader Joe's. To be fair many of the restaurants in the Lambertville/new Hope area I've been similarly disappointing.

Okay, off to the tournament, had cocktails, dinner, and gambled - excellent no issues and I tipped my appreciation.  Bed time, I work remote so had a 9am call, out of the gate for Monday which is typical in my business.  This is where it literally turned into a nightmare - construction adjacent me and above me, omg I called the desk and shared why was I not notified of such events, I would have requested to be moved - it was a Sun/Mon stay - very empty hotel, who the F puts people in the vicinity of such disruptions.  To my displeasure I was in the middle of my calls and could not leave.   I could not relocate due to my schedule was busy. 
Fast forward, after dinner around 1030 pm, I am gambling - know it is a Mon so the place is sparse, not many people - but I am suddenly surrounded by literally people who are obviously not guest, carrying their belongings, and in my space, I move and they follow - it was very sketchy and where are the staff?  I understand there are people less fortunate but I am telling you I did not feel safe and nor would you.  I see there are many 4 and 5 stars - to be honest with you, if it was not for the bartenders and waiters, and cocktail servers I would not give it the 2 stars in my review.

Yet when we got there we decided to ask again and they said yes that was fine, which was good news but there was some miscommunication there. Overall the rooms and casino were very clean but a little dated. We liked that there was a fridge and free water bottles offered in our room. The second problem was the staff members at the 24 hour cafe Milano. We went fairly late and asked John the assistant Manager how long the wait was he said about an hour even, even though there was just two tables being served and I said really it's seems fairly empty. He then said ""oh so you want to be a waitress?"" It was  very out of line especially for being a manger. Also the other young lady before that comment who was working the front desk was very short and rude. I get it it's graveyard but completely unnecessary. 
Besides that we still waited for the food and I'm glad we did because the food was amazing and our waiter was nice, and attentive.

This casino/resort is a CA tourist trap that employs very incompetent crony-upper-mgmt staff to manage departments property-wide.  Their slot machines selections don't have any local favorites, but only  the slots that they want you to play.  Compare the selection to Western village.  Their sportsbook is willing to take your sports bets until you starting beating them regularly, which they will then tell you that they do not want your action anymore.  Their security department is intertwined with Reno PD in a real corrupt way.  Based on reports given to me by friends, Reno PD will rubber-stamp any accusations Peppermill will cite whether true or not.

Hotel is very beautiful On the exterior and rooms aren't bad at all. We love our room every time we normally opt in for a grand suite, we always so happen to get the same room number as well, very funny. Every time we play we head to the electric roulette table and spend all our time there. The last time  we came we waited nearly 40 minutes before a waiter came by , but during that time we did get up about 30minutes in and ask directly to the bartender for drinks. He told us to find our server. (Let me just download the employee files  in my head for who the server is going to be in the area...) then finally the server arrived about 10minutes later  and we got our drinks. So we Chalked it up to the bartender having a bad night. On return today, we spent about 1 full hour at the same roulette table as always and no server, about 10minutes in we asked a server for a drinks. She said unfortunately this isn't her section, so we waited for our server, and We continued to wait and still no server. Finally we went up again to the bartender just as last time  and asked for drinks and sure enough the same person,(John P) finally put a name to a face. told my girlfriend that she needed to find our server. And John proceeded to ask (very rudely) well where are you at???? She said by the roulette table, and then John pointed to a server and said there she is.(she was the server that told us she wasn't working in our specific section . We told John that she wasn't the server in our area and FINALLY the server shows up at that exact moment and we're able to order drinks after 1 Full damn hour later. And then John/ our server and the other server huddled together at the bar rudely turning around just to glare at us , with hand gestures and all making no point to hide completely unprofessional conduct. So you know what it, it is a Beautiful hotel but I don't think the terrible customer service is worth the beauty of this place. Been here plenty of times with my lady but I think a change of hotel for the customer service is near in the future. Thanks a lot John P. We appreciate your terrible service.  Don't make eye to eye contact with someone you've been watching WAIT for a server, so next time don't look if you don't care. Thanks.",2021-08-09 07:19:59 UTC,2,0,0,0,xtputgnepQSc5bbDxPlNHQ

Spoke with Dave at Peppermill, and although some of the issues I mentioned are not invalid, the response regarding the specific loss of ""offers"" has been ""softened,"" although I have a feeling that it will be a more or less long-term issue that must await a change in personnel before I start being treated as I have been for so many years.

I still think that Peppermill is the overall best casino/resort in Reno, and their corporate/business culture seems to be pretty solid, so I'm hopeful that things will get ""back to normal"" as COVID winds down and their business resumes its standard course.  My long-term loyalty will depend on it.  In the meantime, the response moved my review from 2 to 4 stars.

REALLY hoping I can get back to 5 stars (which are admittedly very rare for this reviewer) for the Peppermill Reno.  Fingers crossed and hoping for luck. 

*******************************

It pains me to post this review, because I have been a fan and advocate of Peppermill for many years.  Even after moving to Southern California, Peppermill Reno has been my #1 destination for gambling+good food+player loyalty program.  I typically visit 3-6 times/year, but during COVID, I was absent for good reasons.  The main reason for my 2 star review is that Peppermill suddenly stopped offering me loyalty/gaming-based awards.  This is in a year where I actually INCREASED my play, got to their Bronze Level (not that impressive, but the point is that I INCREASED my play and spend). I sent an email to their Passport Rewards and got a phone call (promising!) only to be told that offers wouldn't be coming since my play wasn't up to snuff.  I could have lost my money many other places, but went out of my way, sometimes driving 8 hours each way, to support them as soon as I was safe to travel.  And my reward?  ""Buh-bye""  SOOO painful, because it's been my go-to for decades.  Oh well, I guess all good things come to an end...  

GOOD:  Vaughn (bartender extraordinaire) in the Fireside Lounge; Food quality and variety; Spa Facilities; eVehicle free charging; airport shuttle

BAD:  Even the""upgraded"" Tuscany tower is showing its age, and not in a good way.  And my room in the Peppermill tower was downright shabby. The Keurig machine was actually, visually DIRTY in the water input area...gross.  There is mold on the (moldy grout-covering) caulking in the bathroom, and the faucet drains are slow.  There was food on the carpet from a prior guest from god knows how long ago...",2021-06-24 16:58:46 UTC,4,0,0,0,opFEr_LPAXXqxm-0kg8-3Q

We heard a couple bad things about some of the other hotels and resorts in the area, so we decided to try The Peppermill. Definitely not a bad stay. This was a three night, four day stay with a free upgrade! We initially booked for a king room with a patio/balcony on the main floor. We were upgraded for free to a king suite on the 16th floor! We were told it was because of the time of day we checked in. So.... 9pm check in from now on it is! 

COVID: 
The hotel and all other connecting restaurants/casino/pool, and facilities had signs everywhere asking everyone to always have a face mask on in the building even if vaccinated. Thank you. There really was never a moment that we didn't feel safe when it came to COVID while staying here. 

The Room: 
Wow! Definitely over the top with decorations and just general decor. I understand that's what they were going for but wow. It absolutely caught our attention when we opened the door to our room. The bed was clean, comfortable, and cozy. It served its purpose. The shower had two heads which was phenomenal. There were his and his sinks for my husband and I, YES! The best part was the giant jacuzzi tub. I definitely enjoyed the tub. The views were phenomenal from our room too on the mountain side. 

The Amenities:
Gym - There is a gym but we're not work-out people (yet) so we didn't visit but still walked by. They had some state-of-the-art equipment in there like the Pelaton with the clip-in and basket holders as well as plenty of weights and treadmills for all. If I were a person trying to get in shape on a mini-vacation, I would have been pleased with this gym. 
Pool - We didn't get the time or opportunity to visit the pools in the middle of the hotel but saw plenty of people enjoying them. 
Spa - Wanted to book but time didn't allow. Heard some great things about it though. 
Casino - It's a casino. Nothing special. Blew some money but we were prepared for it. We're from Baltimore, MD and have a newer casino in town which feels better in chances of winnings than this one. 

Overall... 5 stars for upgrade, hospitality, and cleanliness. Will we stay again if in Reno, probably not due to location to downtown/midtown. Will we recommend to friends and family, yes. You get what  you pay for. 

Thank you for three nights of relaxation and fun.",2021-08-30 12:41:02 UTC,5,1,0,3,lnbYYBzSOdexn_zh_m919g

I was expecting the room to be older and not yet renovated based on past reviews. However, what I did not expect was a lamp/USB charger that turns off every time I get up from the bed (I suppose it's a lamp/USB charger that works based upon body weight) coupled with stained sheets & hairs/stains in the shower. On the bed, I pulled back the covers and the stains were obvious. It was evident that housekeeping simply pulled the cover up without changing the sheets. Gross. When I contacted guest services about needing the sheets changed, they were very prompt in coming to the room & changing them out. It was later when I stepped in the shower & realized that the shower too could use some additional cleaning. I noticed someone else's hair on the shower wall and on the bottom of the tub. I also noticed a stain that could indicate wear and tear. This went along with the wear/tear of the on/off switch for the dimly-lit make-up lamp and the rust-like dot stain under the bathroom sink. I think when the resort says, ""not updated"", they may also want to add in, ""not thoroughly-cleaned"". 

Moreover, the casino, as is typical of casinos, promises ""free drinks"" while you gamble. I understand the need to pay tips. However, I felt taken advantage of by a sly-smiling bartender. I was already playing a game when I ordered a drink & he happily charged me $14 for the 2 drinks (one for myself and one for my traveling companion). I continued playing the game & after he took my receipt, he looked back and grinned. Later on, my traveling companion ordered a drink and was NOT charged. I suppose you need to be furiously pushing buttons to get the ""free drink"" (machines cost between 40 cents to 80+cents per spin here. However, you can find some for 5-25 cents a play if you know where to look).

Most of the staff is courteous and friendly (except the one bartender I described above). This said, I was asked one strange question at check-in. The person at hotel reception asked for my ID & payment card. I gave both. She then looked at me funny, paused, took a breathe, & said skeptically, ""Is your ID valid?"". I was taken aback by the question because if someone is presenting a false ID, you should inspect it yourself-people using false ID's probably wouldn't admit to it. I asked her what she meant by the valid ID question and she cautiously handed back my payment card but held the ID explaining, ""Is this information current on the card?"" Since the ID was a state-issued one 1 month ago, I told her, ""yes"".'Finally after a few more brief moments of her skepticism, I was able to complete the check-in process. I realized she had a trainee badge on but nobody supervising her. Hopefully with time, she learns how to distinguish different ID's & not ask guests to immediately verify validity of their ID's instead of welcoming them.

While they do have plenty of hand sanitizer around and they do promote the use of masks by people who are not vaccinated, I did notice that they are not spraying or wiping down food tables or machines at any regular interval. At the bar I was sitting at, there was sanitizing spray but the bottles were full for reason, they weren't being used at all. When I sat down and started playing, I had to bus my own spot. Similarly, when I ate at the Sports Deli, all the tables were dirty and I had to wipe someone else's food crumbs away with a dry napkin. 

I have decided that this resort is a ""BYOCS"" place (bring your own cleaning supplies) especially if you know you will be staying in one of the older North/South Towers. I would definitely recommend coming with hand sanitizer & a few of your own wipes. You might get to bus your own spot at the bar & the Sports Deli like I did. 

This is a 4 star resort with an overall 2.5 star experience. 

I would say the most positive part of the stay has definitely been the overall friendly and helpful staff. I wouldn't blame them for any of these issues as these are coming from the top-down.",2021-07-25 03:15:15 UTC,3,0,2,3,8A4W6P44SBfVcecgt-vn2g

This time, I decided to stay over on short notice (day of).  They had a room in the West Wing (one of the two unconnected wings that are like annexes to the casino). There was a great deal on this room so it made me wonder if it was going to be jenky, but I was pleasantly surprised! The wing is certainly more modest than the casino hotel - it's only 3 stories and doesn't have a front desk or anything like that - but the room was spacious and nicely styled and felt very similar to their ""normal"" tower rooms.

We were playing slots and they said he was and I quote "" a nuessence"". their was over 10 other strangers around us who pulled their phone out and started recording the situation and telling the security guards they were in the wrong for asking us to leave.

Me and my girlfriend stayed there Valentine's Day til Tuesday morning. 
We arrived and everything was ok at first. But when we got to our room  we went to unpack and get situated. We then hear funny noises. And see that the ENTIRE BATHROOM WAS FLOODED.  I do have prior experience in water damage and restoration, so my first instinct was to get the edges soaked up as quick as possible so that the water doesn't go down to the other floors. I ran out to find house Keeping who said they would sent their supervisor. I did not want to leave the water on the floor  regardless if someone was coming and I'm scooping water up off the floor into everything and anything that had a drain. After 25-30 minutes! FINALLY someone comes. The guy brings a snake.... I told house keeping that our toilet flooded and to send someone with a wet dry vac ( I explained the situation in Spanish which I speak fluently so there wouldn't be any miscommunication and explained the urgency). The guy ends up leaving after another 20 minutes comes back with a wet dry vac and didn't even know how to use it. I told him I can help him out and show him how it works and then he said ""towels would be better.""  The floor was flooded with less water after I was using towels..... I ENDED up using the wet dry vac to suck up the water because he didn't know what he was doing.   Anyways after that we didn't want to stay in a room that had just been flooded. Apparently no one reported the incident and we had to explain the WHOLE situation again and what the guy looked like who came to the room. We do get another room eventually, on the same floor just few doors down. The next day we are there we were gone all day. Came back around 7-8ish pm and house keeping never came. We were gone all day... later that evening we went down to the front desk to tell them we heard bubbling sounds coming out the toilet and water had splashed up. We were afraid more water was going to come gushing out. The lady said not to worry about it and it could just be the plumbing. Well there was a lot to worry about. 
The last day we are leaving and checking out I explain to the front desk lady about the stay and of all things she says.... not a ""oh I'm sorry to hear that"" or  an apologies of sorts. She decided to explain to me that when SHE stays there at the hotel. *An employee of the hotel* She stays at the higher up levels. She basically suggested more me to pay  more next time so I don't have to go through what I went through. I SHOULDN'T have to go through what I went through PERIOD.

On this work trip, it would have made more sense to have had our accommodations booked here as the hotel provided more on location ameneties, but that was out of any of our control. There's several bars spread out in the casino, but this one particular bar near the sports book seemed to be the hangout for the majority of the night. Plenty of seats all around, and lots of video poker machines. While none of us won, we just had a really good time!

Because of the 3 hour difference it was getting late at night and we're all hungry. Looking around for a place to eat, it only left us with the cafe.  Service was really terrible. We all could tell the girl who waited on us was not happy to be there. She was not so customer service friendly. Food was okay, more than what we had anticipated.

Also, They offer this passport reward that my dad signed up for and we been getting a lot of offers like free 2 night 3 day type of deals, sometimes more than that with rewards for games and its amazing! During this pandemic, we decided not to get out of town but once covid gets better, were planning to come back again! I might sign up for the rewards too, because it is worth every penny!

The Peppermill has become our home away from home.  We recently moved from Reno and still have lots of family, friends and work we return home to every month.  We've tried VRBO or extended stay and we're now Peppermill groupies.  You can not beat the midweek rates.  More importantly we're not having to spend time going out to eat, cook, clean or find public places to gather with our limited time.  Everything you need to make a family or business stay a success is here.  The staff greets you with a smile and wants to make sure your stay is excellent.  The rooms are set up with a work station.  The internet is fast and free with IT help 24-7.  The central location has plenty of taxis (or airport shuttles) make getting to business meetings a breeze.  Hotel guests have free indoor parking.  We have been having family and friends over and there is plenty of room for a large crowd or business dinner AND plenty of quiet spaces with seating for business meetings.  

We called down to the Biscotti Cafe and they had no problem accommodating our family party of 12 with high chairs, kids menu and diverse adult menu within the 1/2 hour!  Thank you!  There are several choices in restaurants and pool side service that my grandchildren enjoy.  Next time we'll rent a cabana for the day and have all the kids and grandkids over.   I'd love to get the Lake, but due to limited time in Reno can't...so the several pools are great!  There are plenty of tables and seating to get that good visit in.  There are enough Resturant choices that whether business, family or quick bites you can find healthy lean choices only to be tempted by the homemade gelato...try Mr. Nimo.

We've stayed in both the Peppermill and Tuscany towers and the room sizes are generous and bedding  clean, crisp and inviting.  If you heard CLEAN (yes!) no trash, butts or spill stains on the ground (even the parking garage)!  Kudos to the maid service and cleaning crew.  Thank you.  We've tried several extended stay around south Reno and they were not clean and the beds just soso with cigarette butts everywhere with overflowing trash cans the norm.  It is so nice (great) to find a family business friendly hotel resort staffed with talented people who genuinely want you to enjoy your stay.  If you need anything the Bell Captains will make it happen.  

Another cool thing about the Peppermill...they use geothermal energy found below the resort reducing their carbon footprint.

Neither of us had ever been to Reno before. Biggest mistake to choose Peppermill.

The place looks run down right when you pull into the parking lot. Some of the letters are not lit up and half of the wiring was just exposed from where a mega-monitor should be (I'm guessing).

The next morning at 8am, you can hear what sounds like a jack hammer going off right above our room. We didn't make a big deal out of it because we woke up early to work out and get breakfast anyway. We were out of our room for most of the day. That night, we stayed out late so we wanted to sleep in late the next morning.

The following morning, same thing started up at 8am. Nonstop insane construction noises. I called the front desk and a woman let us know (without starting with an apology) that there would be construction M - F from 8am - 5pm. EXCUSE ME, WHAT? I let her know that we did not know there would be construction and also asked her why would you put us in a room that's basically ground-f*cking-zero?

She had an attitude and said we booked thru a third party, so that's why we wouldn't know there was construction. What kind of bullsh*t excuse is that? I  let her know that we checked their website before booking thru AAA and there is no mention of construction. We weren't even informed at check-in. She continued talking with an attitude, so I asked her if she has a problem with the fact that I am complaining about something that is their fault? She offered to move us to a different room. This is a nice gesture, but it's also a pain in the a** considering we have to pack our sh*t back up. She says someone will call us once the room is ready.

Hours pass, so my gf calls the front desk back asking what is going on. Again - someone who hates their job is on the other line. She says we have to wait until ""around 12 or 1pm"" since people don't check out until 11am. This pissed us off because when we called around 8:30am, we weren't informed we had to wait nearly 5 hours to have our room switched. Eventually we receive an automated text - not a courteous phone call to let us know and to also offer bellhop service - that our room is ready.

We walk out into the hallway and there is literally dust EVERYWHERE and construction workers walking up and down the hallway. The noise is worse in the hallway and we found out that not only was there construction above us, but in the room we share walls with. We're thinking, ""This is a joke, right?""

We head to the front desk to complain and ask to speak to a manager. The woman who was at the front desk (older Asian woman) gets pissed when her colleague says, ""You should get a manager"" as we're speaking to her. She starts to vent to us saying, ""Yeah, no duh I'm going to get a manager, right? Like, let me do my job."" Sorry, but I'm not here to listen to your miserable employees complain.

The manager, Judy, comes out to assist us. I show her videos of the loud construction noises and explain my frustration. Again, we have received not ONE APOLOGY, still. I asked her why she would think it's ok to even place on a floor where construction is taking place, let alone in a room right below and also right next to it. She had nothing to say. My gf even asked her ""When is the last time you've checked this part of the building?"" Her response was, ""Not recently.""

Judy ends up upgrading our room. I let her know that it was also ridiculous that not once had we received an apology. She finally apologizes which obviously means nothing to us at that point. I asked her to comp both nights (no room fee, resort fee, taxes, etc.) because as far as we were concerned, we did not sign up for any of this sh*t show. She assured us we would not be paying anything for those first two days.

The upgraded room was a nice suite. The AC kept making this loud noise in the middle of the night randomly. We didn't feel like complaining about anything else at this point because clearly this place is a dump.

At check-out, they tried to play games and not comp us what they promised they would comp. Judy wasn't there when we checked out, so another manager, Karen (perfect name!) assisted us. She said Judy did not write any notes that correlated with the story we were telling her. I let her know that whatever needs to be done to get my two days comped like we were promised needs to get done ASAP. We played this back-and-forth game for maybe 20min until she gave us what we deserved.

Last, I ask Karen for an itemized bill because God forbid I have to interact with these people again once I leave if the try to play games again. She says they don't give those. Dumbest sh*t I've ever heard. Again, we play back-and-forth until she makes a phone call and SURPRISE! We get our itemized statement.

Needless to say: Don't stay here.",2021-12-15 01:53:56 UTC,1,0,7,4,JuOks-2Sf2S1UOyRji745g

I live in Reno and really want to support the locals (casinos, bars and restaurants) because I love going to the local places and I really appreciate them. But I was at the Peppermill this afternoon waiting for some friends I was meeting for dinner. I went to the sports bar and then to the Fireside Lounge and was ignored by both. The sports bar was an unbelievable experience. It did not look busy so I thought this was a good choice for me. I sat at a table and realized they did not have table service so I went to the bar. The bartender served a guy standing next to me, then walked over to talk to a coworker without ever making eye contact. I was literally standing next to a guy that the bartender was making drinks for, he gave him the drinks, and then he came back after processing the check. Then he walked over to a coworker, his back to me, and yacked. I thought okay they need to talk about something and then he will come back. Nope. So I went to the Fireside Lounge and I sort of understood being ignored there because the bartender was running all over and there did not appear to be any servers. The problem is that he went past me SIX times and all he said was 'how ya doin?' Really? You couldn't even ask what I wanted and said it would just take a minute? I am not playing games and expecting (expensive?) free mixed drinks but I will PAY. (The people he was serving when he went past me 6 time were also not gambling. They were sitting at a table about 3 feet from me.) 
I left that place too and went to the Back Bar. Amazing bartender (Sara) was juggling drinker/gamblers, drinker/gambler/go- pick- up- some- food for them and people like me who just WANTED A GLASS OF WINE. Thank God for Sara. I was there about a minute and she brought some patrons their food in plastic containers (from who knows where) got drinks for some gamblers, got my wine and water and fixed the food order that the other people ordered.  She left soon after and I am sorry I did not get the name of the next bartender because he too was attentive.  Thank you Back Bar!! I appreciate the service, the attention, and the fact that not everyone is a gambler but we still want to be part of scene!",2021-06-21 04:31:36 UTC,3,0,1,1,LrnAiFVkItsFi6UdHQGzdA

Finally, I've returned visiting the Peppermill after the COVID19 Pandemic left every person in an unsettled state with my dear friend, PJN who calmly stated she promised she'll only spend $10.00 playing the slot machines . . . 

Rambling through the Peppermill, both PJN and wore our masks due to the cigarette smoke in the air was thick!  I can't breathe any type of smoke because I'll have a full blown asthma attack!

Anyway, PJN cruised to the Peppermill Cashier in order, obtaining dollar bills.  Remember, PJN PROMISED she would only spend $10.00; however, in the end, PJN spent $11.00 on the slot machines and she wanted playing a little more.  But I retorted, she'll lose all her money preventing her from going to Reno Airport in the morning then, she'll have to live with me at my Placerville House-LOL!  

So, we left Peppermill heading back to David Walley's Mineral Hot Springs.

This place is really good. A very nice resort casino, very clean, and most importantly such friendly, and gracious customer service from all staff members. 

Now for the most important topic, food! I only ate at three of the several different eateries they have. The first was Biscotti's. The food at Biscotti's is excellent! I recommend the fish and chips, prime rib sliders, and buffalo wings. Second was Oceano which is a sushi/seafood restaurant that offers all you can eat sushi as an option. We ordered a bunch of different sushi rolls and all were excellent. Only knock on this place for me is that my favorite nigiri sushi, maguro, was not very good, but my second favorite, hamachi was! Lastly, the Sports Deli, located near the sports betting was the best of the lot for me! We had the NY sub and pizza and both were outstanding! I'm a simple guy and this place was perfect for me. I would've eaten here everyday if not for some planned dinners offered by the conference.  Almost forgot, they have a very nice fine whiskey bar. My boss bought me a very nice 21 year old Redbreast (I know how it sound but it's Irish whiskey lol).  

As far as the hotel itself, like I said, excellent service and clean. My only complaint is that the shower was like fine tuning to get the water temp just right. I'd also like to give a shout out to anyone who was staying there during our conference as there were several ""networking"" nights in some of the rooms and not a single noise complaint! Thanks!

We had a fairly decent time, the prices were as expected and the suite with the large tub was pretty nice, plus the steam shower is great.

That being said, half the tub controls worked, one of the bubble tubes on it produced no bubbles and the working controls stuck and had to be toyed with to get it to twist properly.


The main contention point came after cleaning the room and organizing a bit to make it easier for the staff to quickly clean the rest of the room after we left. 
 We had even left a tip for them.

In our hurry out, we left my partners stuffed bear of high sentimental value (One she had well over the last 7 years) behind so we called the hotel and they had said if they found it they'd keep it at the desk. OK, well it was not hidden and in plain sight in the room, so I headed back in that evening to be told by the staff that they do not keep things and if it was not thrown away it would be in the lost and found now.

So I ask for directions to it, and was given a vague description drawn by the attendant on the map they had of the floor.

After twenty minutes of stumbling around another attended wandered up to me and pointed me in the direction.

The catch when found, is that you have to call security to come down and unlock the lost and found, with a phone they have on the wall near the office. So after a talk with who ever was on the other end, and a 45 minute wait without anyone showing up, an attendant who obviously was not security tried to flag someone down for me. 
 Could not do so and then unlocked the room himself. Looked through the ""filing system"" they had and told me no stuffed animals had been turned in and to come back around 4 AM as that is when the shift changes and the cleaners may turn in lost items.

Came back the following morning, and no turn in. They told me to put in a request on the website to make sure they keep a look out and to call to make sure.

Fast forward two weeks of calling and a return notice -informing us nothing was found but they were going to check the laundry area to make sure it wasn't there- only to be answered by an attendant who told us we need to stop calling and that an email will be sent to us if anything is found.


All in all, if you leave something behind here, don't expect to get it returned sadly. The hotel stay was nice, but the run around and loss was sadly not.",2021-05-23 15:05:47 UTC,3,0,1,2,K0BaEEAqFSbGe76EFtkiuQ

Room
Some guy next door continually yelled ""the F bomb"" all day and night. Though we complained to the front desk and had someone go to room to complain of  noise, it didn't stop him
Electricity in room went out and I woke up at 4 am (my sleep apnea machine went out.  Called operator and they said it would be up to an hour to get generator back on.  Luckily we didn't have to wait that long.

SLOTS
Though we played the penny machines, the max on them was minimum $3 - $8 a shot. The  more you play max the more likely you'll get something back.  What we got back was 10 cents, or 25 cents or 50 cents on $6 or $8.  It was the worst return on investment ever.  We moved from one machine tot he other and got Nothing.  So much so that I dropped $600.  I guess the management isn't aware that you gotta give more in order for people to come back. It was still busy and lots of people there. I even stopped an employee working the floor and told him that I would not come back to flush my $ down the toilet.  He told me he was getting a lot of those complaints from people, that the machines are tight.  Well a constipated machine isn't going to help those that feed it.

The hotels rooms were spacious and clean and I recommend staying in the Tuscany tower. It's a bit of a walk but completely worth it. Customer service does take longer than necessary (we want to play!) but they handled our issues with professionalism and courtesy, so no issues with that. We didn't take advantage of the pool when we were there, however they are beautiful and never crowded when we go, which includes both weekends and weekdays. The restaurants are PHENOMENAL, truly. Bimini's is my absolute favorite (lamb chops yummm). Oceano's has the best AYCE sushi I've ever experienced and the pricing is not bad at all- go hungry. We went to Milano's for brunch and it was great as well, but breakfast is really hard to screw up, so nothing that exceeded expectations here.  Finally, the casino floor- the machines have always been fair to generous on our trips, although I have not been back since last October. I've heard the machines are tighter now, so I'll have to update this after my next visit in June. Casino bathrooms are very clean and well maintained, no trash anywhere as I've heard of other casinos. Atmosphere is light, airy and clean compared to that of others where you feel like you're in a dingy dark pit. They give good incentives, free rooms and multiple times points when you book. All in all, our favorite place to go! 

One critique and that is the resort fee isn't really justified compared to that of GSR where there are actually activities to DO. Peppermill has basically a gorgeous pool, a lovely spa and an arcade. They charge the fee because they can, I get it, it's a tourism thing and it's an extra $40 they can get from every reservation. It's a bit of a stretch to say this is a great choice for a family- I would consider this a great vacation spot for couples or for groups of adults. I'd definitely struggle to find things my two young children could do here to stay busy. We would definitely need to venture out to have some family fun. THAT being said, I would still STAY here for the quality of rooms, cleanliness and for the great customer service even on a family vacation. But I'd likely drive my kids over to GSR or other places for the bowling, escape rooms, ice rinks and movies etc for the kiddos. You cannot go wrong with staying here, truly consistently great experiences from check in to check out.

Plus, it's a huge hotel and some impressive restaurants built around a casino.  And the gaming pays the bills.  So don't be sore about having to walk miles around the machines and tables to get where you're going.

When - if - you get to your hotel room don't be surprised that real money was spent on impressive marble, tile work, wallpaper and fixtures.  However, they completely missed installing a ventilation fan in our bathroom (Peppermill Tower, Room 953).  And aside from the shock (I mean, Motel 6 has bathroom fans!) this presented a few practical difficulties that you can imagine.  I found myself wishing they in the absence of the exhaust fan they had equipped our bathroom with a small radio and perhaps a candle.

Literature in our room advised that a floor-by-floor room renovation program was scheduled to begin soon (our stay was in December 2021).  Upgrades are certainly due, especially to the mechanicals (elevators, fans! and fixtures).  Meanwhile, the place was clean and the bedding - especially the pillows - were top drawer.

I'm not a gambler, so bells and mirrors and Zeus-on-a-pedestal add little value for me.  But these folks are trying hard to provide an 'experience', and that counts for something.  Give 'em a try, but you'll want to ask about construction and angle for the newer rooms. And for God's sake, pack the Febreeze.",2021-12-31 05:30:06 UTC,3,0,1,1,nPLo0w9oEsTSCnTuRFLteQ

We had 2 rooms in the North West tower which to us was fine since it was really just for us to lay down for the night. 

When we checked in, Julie, was amazing. We had requested adjoining rooms so the kids could play and not make too much noise going back and forth between rooms. 

After speaking with her manager, she upgraded us for free to a penthouse suite in the Peppermill Tower. After receiving our keys, we packed up to get the kids... She stopped us and said I still need
to give you it keys got out other room. We had assumed the penthouse was given in place of the 2 rooms but more and behold we got 2 penthouse suites. It was amazing. And the kids definitely deserved it after being in the Idaho National Forrest fly 3 days with zero wifi.

Also one pool was open during during our stay and it was the smallest one they had. There's 2 pools and both should have been open, especially the bigger one. The hot tub was closed as well due to COVID. We didn't use the pool once since it was so crowded with people every time we wanted to use it.

As far as the casino, I was not impressed and actually disappointed. Numerous empty cups and bottles near the slot machines that hadn't been cleaned up. Chairs sticking out everywhere, not pushed in, made it very hard to walk through the all the machines. Furthermore those chairs were way to bulky and big, need to have a little smaller chairs so they are easy to pull out and push back in.

We just got back from a 5 night stay in a Luxury suite.  This was the most disappointing trip ever.  I passed on staying at a suite at the GS resort that was cheaper and looked much better because I wanted the jacuzzi in the room and was familiar with the Peppermill.  The luxury suite was so outdated.  Mind you when you pay in excess of $1500 for a room chances are you plan on spending some time in there (hubby just enjoys relaxing in the room on vacations).  The room was so drab it was depressing.  Now on to the food.  We tried Bimini's, Biscotti's, Milano Cafe, Oceano and room service.  I give 0 would stars for the food.  The best thing I had was the crab sandwich at Oceano & the tortellini pasta salad at Biscotti's Cafe.  Do not order a steak anywhere in the hotel.  It will be unseasoned and not cooked to your liking.  Our last night we had room service.  I had a steak sandwich & hubby had steak dinner.  Neither of us finished our steaks.  Now there were other issues that we encountered with our stay that was addressed with Management before we left.  However, one issue that did not get addressed and was totally unacceptable, I cannot excuse.  I was checking my mobility scooter in to be picked up by the rental company.  I was the only person at the desk.  I had explained to the Bell Desk guy that I needed to take a picture of the ticket when this couple walked up and handed them their ticket.  He takes their ticket and walks off to get their luggage.  I'm sitting there in dismay like wth... After he gets back and gives them their luggage I confronted him.  He tried to say he thought I was going to take a picture of the scooter.  No matter what you thought you knew you had not checked my scooter in and finished with me and I was here before the couple.  This type of blatant disregard towards a customer of color is inexcusable! As bad as this trip was I will say the Management, Dave & Dan, immediately addressed most of our concerns before we left.",2021-08-14 00:03:39 UTC,2,0,0,0,8VicIcGKtLXs6ygcNXQVhg

Staying in a suite this time, the Peppermill Grand Suite (see attached pictures). It's quite grand accommodations! This is the essence of comfort! The bed is super comfortable, especially the soft sheets, with the appropriate level of warmth, but not too much so. The in-suite Jacuzzi is a welcome feature. Nothing like a comfortable soak. 

I would have awarded five stars, but some of my dining experiences have been less than worthy (see my review of Oceano). I had a horrible lunch at Oceano my first day. The food was not fresh, nor of good quality. It was quite bad! A bit surprising, since I have dined there in the past without issue. 

My dining experiences at Cafe Milano and Biscotti's on this trip have been good so far. As for other amenities, the casino and common areas have been clean and welcoming.

It's a nice place. It was clean, the casino is large, and the restaurants are good. However, our experience this morning with room service breakfast is what lowered my review to 4-stars. The menu had variety and prices were reasonable. So we thought (about that later). My husband ordered the Belgian waffle and I ordered the cinnamon chip French toast. It came quickly, but that's the only good thing I can say about it. I can honestly say I enjoy Denny's breakfast more. My husband forced his down because he was hungry, but I only ate 1/4 of my French toast. It was pretty flavorless and the bread was a little doughy to me. Later, when we checked out using the mobile option, I realized we were charged $64 for that nasty shit that in reality was priced less than $30 on the menu. That means they charged about $35 just to bring it upstairs to us? Plus the tip we gave them? I understand there being a charge but that much?

I liked the vibe of the old restaurant and lounge so I was curious to see how the Peppermill Reno resort would be.  My husband and I stayed here for a few days.  Parking was initially tough as lots of cars filled spots on Saturday late afternnon.  We eventually found a spot in the structure and once we were acclimated to the location of our hotel, we moved closer the next day.

Upon entrance, the place is impressive-the lights, decor, and all.  We had meals in the Biscotti Cafe and Cafe Milano which will be separate reviews.
At first we were in the West Wing which is a short walk separate from the main tower.  This was not good as our next door neighbors in a locked adjoining room were loud and kind rowdy.  I went to the front desk to address the concern and the young lady was so on it in customer service.  She got the OK from her supervisor and moved us to a room in the north wing in the main tower.  Much better!  Both rooms we had were clean and the housekeeping staff were efficient.  In-person, the front desk clerks that we interacted with were good.  They also informed us that masking is optional if fully vacc'd.

Can't say much about the casino as we are not into gambling but, if you need to make your way to Cafe Milano, Romanza, or Oceano in the casino, be aware of potential secondhand smoke and mask up.  The hotel has a top rated spa, Spa Toscana, a gym, pool, shops, convention center, and an arcade for the young and young-at-heart.  This place is huge and it is easy to get lost in the Peppermill so if you're unfamiliar, use the map or just ask the staff. :)

Overall, our stay at the gorgeous Peppermill was pleasant and I'm sure we'll return if visiting the Reno area again.  Cheers!",2021-08-02 18:33:37 UTC,4,14,6,14,Otq5WpEKxbotfnCUNDeFpA

Tuscan-inspired resort hotel offering plush quarters & eclectic dining, plus a nightclub & a casino.
Dealers and pit bosses are the best! Huge diversity in staff as well as games. 
They also have a party room if you planing a party for kids. The place is ... Game Lab is a big arcade located on the 3rd floor. Pools, waterfall, huge spas.  I even played craps and found out my dice skills are lacking. If you want to give this a try..I recommend you do it in the early evening when there's less people. Dealers can and will assist your betting. Also it's not as fast, customers expect beginners and can take a joke .
 Every 21 dealer I had was great not burned out. Very professional.  I try to play with them. As a handicap woman traveling alone I have nobody rooting for me but the pit Boss and the dealer it's nice they are very supportive.  I imagine it can be a little boring for them to feel fresh daily, so I bet with them sometimes.
 Let's talk about cocktail waitresses. You are not going to wait, they are there on the spot nearly as you sit. I always tip them they're on their feet all day working through this pandemic. Usually cost of drinks very in the different restaurants, lounges and bars so I figure a dollar is reasonable whether I'm winning or losing.
Let's talk about baggage handlers. Most patrons don't understand this Resort has a computer system that rotates, fairly distributes the work. I'm sure most customers don't know so I'm going to mention it. I do tip on arrival, then again to drop off person. Both are important jobs. I usually take everything from my car so there's usually three-  five bags. Varying in sizes a dollar for each is what I do. I take everything out of my car always. Never know when you might need something it's worth the buck a bag.
My stay was in the Tuscany Tower thanks to David Fuller.  It's a modern glass structure, reflecting sun and sky from outside. Inside the room was classic style of Tuscan luxury. Warm colors evoke rolling green Italian hillsides. As you walk in it even has relaxing music. Plush hotel room interiors offer peace and comfort. I was able to enjoy the Jacuzzi bathtub handles on both sides, telephone in the bathroom gives you the confidence to try and I highly recommend. I felt secure these are handicapped safe rooms. You feel like you need a handicap stool just go ahead, call they're happy to bring one up. 
Last but not least, Peppermill features an easy and convenient airport shuttle, which departs from the valet area outside the Hotel Lobby, and runs every half-hour beginning at 4:30am. It goes to the international airport if you're flying out of a different airport you might want to ask for consideration on that but there's plenty of taxis in Ubers you shouldn't have any problems getting to any destination from this conveniently located hotel.
I had a marvelous time. I highly recommend. Huge hotel with thousands of people, with thousands of people, comes thousands of personalitys. Signs are posted where you can smoke. Masks must be worn expect to be reminded. No rules will be broken. 
Security is absolutely there for your assistance. They are highly trained specialist. Can answer questions, don't hesitate to ask.",2021-03-20 21:23:08 UTC,5,2,1,3,-2_AowoFYz8DP8A5HyC2xA

We moved from California to Tennessee 6 years ago so we've missed it. On a recent trip out West to visit family we decided to take the opportunity to stay at our favorite resort. To say we are sorely disappointed is an understatement, and none of this should have anything to do with Covid. Upon arriving at the room and taking my shoes of I immediately noticed how slicj the carpeting seemed. Sure enough, about an hour in I slipped and fell. No serious injury, just a couple of bruises. Later on the same day my husband walked into the bathroom, hit a spot on the marble floor and slipped too. We called housekeeping and notified them, thinking that maybe a previous guest had used some kind of product and it had gotten on the floor. They came to the room, checked it out and concluded that the carpet was slippery because it was new and the bathroom floor was slippery due to recently having been polished. Okay, but it's STILL not safe for guests. They did nothing to remedy the situation  The next morning I slipped on the carpeting AGAIN.  Our last morning we went down to Biscotti's restaurant for breakfast. Our server was Olga. Instead of toast with his breakfast my husband asked if he could get a biscuit and gravy.  Olga didn't seem to think that could be done for some reason, but she said she'd ask and see what could be done.  I didn't think a biscuit and gravy was such a strange thing to ask for??? She never let us know the outcome of this apparently unworldly request. When she came with our breakfast she literally handed my husband TWO full breakfasts. He got the breakfast he had requested AND a huge plate full of biscuits, gravy WITH potatoes. When my husband told her her had only wanted ONE biscuit with gravy she responded that was the only way he could get them!!! She then proceeded to charge him $13 for this!!

They should have sent security up. And we kept getting the smell of cigarettes in our non smoking room like it was coming through the vents or under the door. Very disappointed for such an expensive room. Another strange little thing in our room, when we got in we noticed plastic covering our smoke detector, yeah don't think it will work real well that way. And found what appear to be dried French fries under the bed ? Housekeeping did a horrible job. I also used the online check out, I had literally just finished and was about to head out the door, when housekeeping came right in, no knock no announcement nothing, very irritating",2021-04-18 14:59:38 UTC,1,0,0,0,_KQ3l0lTKUr-vLvsdufkNQ

Just checked in to Peppermill and highly disappointed.  I normally use Booking or expedia to reserve rooms, but being that we are in a pandemic, and this is my family's first time out I used Peppermill's official site.  After reading countless reviews, we decided to go with the Tuscany Tower Suite rooms.  My 7 year old was exteemely excited to have a jacuzzi bathtub to use during our stay, as we did not want to use the pool.  Again, this was our family's first time out since the pandemic, so we based our expectations of what we were paying for and hoping to receive on what the official Peppermill website advertised for our room specifically.  Spoiler alert: I've had better experiences with third party websites. 

 Pro: The room came with the 2 King beds we wanted. Surprised to find a small patio.

Cons: 
1. We checked in on our phone, got the text that our room was ready, and to check in at a kiosk. We go in and KIOSK weren't working, we still had to check in at the front desk. :( Female (Jenna, Jen...not sure) was not welcoming, she sounded like she didn't want to assist us with checking into our room. 
2. Bathroom did not match the description on the site at all. NO jacuzzi bathtub, NO  enclosed shower or private toilet area, and NO his/her sinks. 
  Imagine our shock when we saw this!!! 
3. POOR customer service!!! After seeing that we were missing many of the amenities we were looking forward to, I immediately called front desk. The male who took the call did not give his name, but told us there were NO rooms in the whole hotel with the jacuzzi bathtub available. Then he says they do have a smoking room available. 
4.  I turn it down! I tell him that it is false advertisement, because on the site under the room we booked, we saw the floor plan and the features listed, and those were the main reasons for booking at Peppermill and not at Atlantis or GSR, are not in the room they gave us. He says there is nothing he can do about that. 
  We spent over $200 for a ""Suite"" but given a regular room and told there is nothing they can do about it. NEVER RETURNING!",2021-01-31 03:54:44 UTC,1,0,0,1,W6cwa-npQwAdnt_p8eosxA

So that was a drag.  The housekeepers in the North Wing were very pleasant and nice people.  We were put into the North Wing N3036 and the room was VERY SMOKY.  It was hard to sleep when the entire room was engulfed in cigarette smoke in a NON-SMOKING room.  So we complained.  They said they'd bring up an air purifier, but they never did.

Even during Covid, The Peppermill operates like a well-oiled machine, and it operates safely to boot. At first I was nervous to go inside of a casino with what I anticipated to be A LOT of people around... But, Peppermill employees ensure that mask-wearing is followed by all patrons, and the ubiquitous plexiglass barriers are bountiful, if not an astonishing sight. 

The Covid regulations were never overwhelming, but quite the opposite. It was a reassuring, FUN time. Another obstacle I've never navigated until recently is riding in an elevator during... well you know... times. The Peppermill ensures safety by regulating that only 4 patrons ride in an elevator at the same time. But, for our two night stay, my partner and I ALWAYS had the elevator to ourselves. 

Room service was delightful on both nights of our stay. The jetted tub is always delightful. BUT! I found a new funny (?) noise surprise... if your neighbor on the floor above you starts their jetted tub at 4 am you may be out of luck in the noise-cancelling department.

I definitely need to give my extra thanks to some specific staff members that went the extra mile for me and I need to recognize them! 
TONY THE BELLMAN WHO WENT WAY OUT OF HIS WAY TO HELP ME GET A VERY IMPORTANT PACKAGE MAILED OUT! HE HELPED ME EVERY STEP OF THE WAY MAKING MY STRESS LEVEL GO ALL THE WAY DOWN AND TOTALLY MADE MY DAY WITH HIS KNOWLEDGE HELP AND KINDNESS! THANK YOU SO MUCH TONY!!!

It has enough to do that you could come for your stay and never go out. Peppermill is another longtime favorite of locals and it caters to them. Kind of older and not as fancy anymore but still is better than most other hotels.The location is farther south and close to the Atlantis which makes hopping between each a pretty easy and fun trip. 

It has plenty to do besides just gambling. It's a pretty large resort. This is among the more family friendly choices in Reno. Kids can have fun in the arcade. Many newer and older games. Get something to eat. There's a few cafes and restaurants. Cafe Espresso has coffee and pastries. Quick place for breakfast and snacks. Cafe Milano is a full service cafe. There's typical breakfast like omelets and dinner like steaks. Also pamper yourself if you feel like. There's a spa out by the big pool. 

Charges a pretty annoying resort fee. It's expected because there's actually a lot to see here. The cafes are overpriced and the casino smells.",2021-08-15 19:28:01 UTC,5,9,4,10,4YbH8gUYf2bRNxThXNgW4Q

First I called the day prior and informed first desk I would be doing a late check and told me them my arrival time. Upon my arrival with my cousin, our RESERVED room was still given away and we were given a room with unnecessary hot tub that took up a lot of space in the room we were given. Barley enough room to walk through with a roll in bed. In addition, after we finished eating and playing some casino games (barley seen any staff cleaning the machines or at least have someone walking around to look like they were cleaning). We were locked out our room at 3am, security had to wait for maintained to come. He said he would be there ""in a minute"" and security said he was unsure how long ""a minute "" could take since it was late. They ""fix"" the door but the catch was one of us had to be in the room at all times in order fo us to have access. I didn't pay to be trapped in a room.m, in addition this room had a phone that was not connected to the wall, not working at all. Extremely dangerous in case of an emergency and just plain unacceptable, like seriously. They transfer us to a suite, which was nice. I left an item in the room , upon moving to our final room for the remainder of our 2day stay. Instead of house keeping turning it in to lost and found or logging it in at the front desk, it was thrown away/taken. The cold part about it is that I knew specifically were I left it and explained to them when I informed them I left an item in our temporary room. Don't count on anything turning up in lost and found here. The cherry on top was when our first bell hop employee came in to move us to our temporary  room, I told him about he phone not being connected and how this was unsafe, he thought it was a ""haha-hehe"" moment and was laughing. Worst first experience ever. I will definitely not be returning back to this tacky establishment, the bright lights is all that it is. I highly recommend this place as a last resort. I recently stayed from 3/26/21-3/28/21. Again, spend your money elsewhere where service is better.",2021-03-31 03:50:03 UTC,1,0,0,0,1gzVXyhydkBtslQyGd-W3Q

Even so, they are fun every so often, and not for very long. This is how I feel about Las Vegas.

Peppermill is I think one of the classier spots in Reno. It is very clean and well maintained, but it feels a bit dated and gaudy all the same, to say nothing of the ever-present cigarette stench. Instant headache! It's also as if they want to cover the cigarette stench on the casino floor, so it smells like a weird mixture of hand soap and cigarettes. 

Game-wise, there are many ways to lose money ;) My fiance liked the sports book section, which is huge and has huge screens to match! The slots are typical slots- I didn't play them, so I am not an expert. The blackjack tables have a minimum of $10. Every dealer we had was fun and had a good sense of humor, except one dealer who was very rude when I made a minor error, since I have barely ever played before. She was on a power trip and made it seem like she was doing me a favor by not ""kicking me out."" I can assure you that I didn't do anything super egregious! 

The food here is not that great. The brunch we ate at Biscotti's was so average- neither of us ate food with really any flavor. Even so, the drink service on the casino floor is efficient and friendly. There is never a shortage of alcohol (nor of varieties thereof) here. Also, as if to keep you there longer, but I am not complaining: Free parking, free wifi.

The rooms themselves are nice. They are well updated and very clean. But they fit an aesthetic that to me seems a bit dated and Real Housewives esque. The bathroom was huge! My main concern is that the AC seemed weak, no matter how low we made the temperature. The air felt surprisingly muggy within the room, even though Reno is more of a ""dry heat."" It was never really that comfortable to sleep: the bed shifted too easily whenever the other person did (low quality mattress), and the down blanket combined with the weak AC made it feel way too hot and stuffy to be comfortable.

If you are in Reno, this could be a good place to visit and stay, since I think it is within the upper echelon. Even so, there are problems to be aware of.",2021-06-03 21:21:43 UTC,3,0,0,0,_fD_1RKZIlA6SVUrJ8B-PA

I can see why they rank an AAA Four Diamond resort. 

Great service from check in to check out. Checked in late on a Sunday and checked out on a Tuesday. Both times checked in person and had pleasant experiences. You can check in/out using a kiosk if you prefer. 

I did have a few issues but doesn't effect my rating. I booked a 2 complimentary night stay in the Tuscany tower suite through MyVEGAS app (80,000 gold coins going currently as of June 2021) so only had to pay resort fees. Total 41.55 US per night. My helper Brandon checked us in and said that they were booked at capacity and had an event that would have to split our stay. So he comped us $50 food and beverage credit for the inconvenience which I later used for breakfast and gelato at Biscottis. 

Other than that friendly staff and great ambience from the interior decor to the suite room and pool. Gives off Las Vegas hotels Bellagio vibes. 

I stayed at the Tuscany Tower which is all suites. I really enjoyed the whirlpool jetted tub. However, it did smell of chlorine water. 

The outdoor pools are amazing. They are heated at just the right temperature. The entrance is close to the Tuscany Tower. I would say a bit far if staying at a different location. They were open from 6 am  to 10 pm during our stay. The smaller pool opened at 6 am and the bigger pool opened at 8 am. 

Played at the game lab which opened at 9am. It has a good variety of games. Had a $10 voucher received upon check in. 

I also gambled since they had a promotion for new players. Up to $100 back in losses. I don't gamble a lot but this was a nice incentive to play and not have to worry about losing a lot. But knowing if I lost, I would be reimbursed. But I actually was in the positive so didn't have to go back to redeem. 

Overall, great place to stay and check out when in Reno.",2021-07-01 05:18:31 UTC,5,0,0,0,G1JgVmuLHuHOnDAADQgDpg

Ok so we thought everything was good. Then as I was putting on my makeup, water dripped on my face from the vent above. We had to put a towel down on the floor because of the slow but active drip. Seeing it was our last night, we did not report it.

Front of House: ignored us for ten minutes when we arrived. It was not busy either. She said one moment when we walked in and it took us ten minutes before we even could tell her we had a reservation.

Waiter: Average service. Answered questions. Food came out timely. Was not attentive with drinks and requests.

All dishes were delicious.
Death By Gumbo: rich, flavorful, and unique. Never had a gumbo designed this way.
Crab Beignet: Perfectly golden brown. Gooey crab filling inside. Like a melty crab cake (without cheese)
Wagyu Boudin Ball: Meaty, crunchy and tasty.
Lobster Gnocchi: Soft and airy gnocchi. Sauce was balanced and comforting.

Started with foie gras app cause had to and so glad I did. It was amazing, great pairings and levels of flavors. That other review is wrong it was cooked great and had great flavor. Also tried the crab beignets, skip it. It's just ok and the batter is too much.  

Ordered the short rib and lobster  which was very tender and tasty. Got side of mushrooms which was also great. Ordered a side of bourbon bone marrow and wow!

On our last visit to New Orleans, this was far and away our favorite restaurant. We couldn't stop talking about it and, when we booked another visit to New Orleans for our wedding anniversary, immediately made a dinner reservation. When the over-the-top faux-friendly waiter introduced himself, I explained right up front that I am gluten- and dairy-intolerant, and asked for his help in selecting my meal. Then our cocktails arrived, and promptly were spilled all over us by the server. The meal was fine, not nearly as memorable as last time, but fine enough. Until dessert, that is. I ordered sorbet and when it arrived, took a bite or two before I realized to my horror that they had served me ice cream instead of sorbet, despite my very clearly explaining up front that I could not eat dairy or gluten. I told the waiter, and they apologized and brought me sorbet and to make up for it, get this, no joke, profiteroles! The manager came over and weakly apologized and took some small amount off the bill, but that was hardly the point. Thankfully I did not need a visit to the ER that night, but I was just lucky. The waiter had told us that when they reopened after Covid they hired back only 20% of their staff. Evidently the wrong 20% if you ask me. The most senior team members, the manager and waiter, were by far the weakest and least genuine links in the chain. It shows what happens when corporate policy gets in the way of customer service.

We were told by our waiter that they would be able to get those heated to temperature rather quickly which happened. Unfortunately, the steaks came out completely chard on both sides. The charring of the stakes was visible to everyone at the table so it was really disappointing that the chef, and the waiter did not have that conversation in the back before they brought it out. However, since the other people at the table with us we're already done eating their entrées they ate some of the steaks.

Then, Da'Shawn hands us the cocktail menus and a separate wine menu that's on an in-house iPad with searchable features by country, region, price, or any other filtering you might need. We decide on the Saintsation and the Lower Garden and they're good enough to order more throughout the meal. Spread out over the next three hours, we get the free house cornbread to start, one serving more crispy and another cooked to perfection and both served with a choice of olive oil, sea salted butter, or sweet butter with cane syrup. Try a little of each topping with the bread because they each provide a little something different. Then, we started with the Turtle Soup with Deviled Eggs and the Blue Crab Beignets. The beignets have been a return try because they converted a non-seafood me to like crab cakes and a whole world of food. The turtle soup was different from anything we've had and meshed well with the deviled egg, but we were split on whether this was worth an order again or just an interesting bite. The main meal came when Da'Shawn told us we could have half-portions of the pastas, so we ordered a half of the Duck Confit Ravioli and the Lobster Gnudi. Both were mouth-watering, with a standout in the filling for the Duck Ravioli, but the best were our meat entrees. We got the 8-oz Center Filet with truffle butter and foie gras and the special, a 16-day Ages Rack of Lamb with a red-wine reduction and a lobster tail on top. The steak stands on its own, but is even better with the truffle butter and the lamb was delicious.

But if you want a swanky dining experience in New Orleans the food and atmosphere are a must at this restaurant. We made the fatal mistake of not making reservations prior to arriving in town so we did the first come first serve at the cocktail tables and bar. Our experience was still quite wonderful. Our waitress took care of us very well. Unfortunately the Saintsation drink was not available that evening so i went with the margarita and a berry spritzer. Both completely delish and light and refreshing with our heavy meal. I started with the crab beignets which melted in my mouth. It's truly a must have from the menu. Fried oysters that my partner ordered were good and made great by the sauces that accompanied them. The highlight of the meal was my entree. It's was a different take on surf and turf. Lobster chunks surrounding boneless short ribs topped with a sweet balsamic vinaigrette reduction over creamy mashed potatoes. SO very good. I was floating while eating that part of my meal. I cleaned my plate and refrained myself from licking it lol. Last was the dessert which we shared that was simple and sweet. More creme brûlée than bread pudding but delicious nonetheless. We thought we could go out after that meal but instead we passed out. It was a great experience and i want to do it again in the main dining room next time,2021-06-02 04:48:30 UTC,5,2,1,3,fA36Efbqfr0M7OPL-kQnlw

I am here for a long weekend and decided to visit one upscale restaurant while down here. The food was delicious and the service was outstanding. I had such a pleasure speaking with the crew who were all so accommodating! Heavy handed on the wine pour, willing to ask the chef if they served bone marrow which is typically served only during special holidays, and giving us solutions when we couldn't decide on an entree.
 
I tried the fried oyster salad, bone marrow, wagyu tartare, quail 3 ways, and bread pudding for dessert. Everything was delicious and well thought out. The only thing I would critique is that the wagyu tartare was over dressed, so you couldn't really appreciate the richness of the wagyu (tender, but can't taste the beef--only the dressing)

This review will highlight the food from my most recent trip to NOLA in October of 2021.

Meal 1

I started with the Yellowfin Tuna Crudo w/Alligator Pear, Red Onion, Ginger, Radish, Shaved Apple
For those who know me or have read other reviews, I'm a sucker for crudo and this did not disappoint. The stand out here was actually the completeness of the dish. The fish was velvety in texture, fresh and delicately delicious. The pear, red onion, ginger, radish, and shaved apple did not over power but instead offered a wonderful contrast in texture and flavors that resulted in complete harmony on the palate. 

My husband started with dry-aged steak tartare w/cured egg yolk, pickled shallot, black garlic mustard, and house made fingerling chips.
He raved about this dish...and I say for good reason.  I did have a taste and found it to be a powerhouse of a starter.  How raw beef can be so darn tender is a mystery. The mustard brought zing along with the pickled shallot while the egg yolk contributed to the creaminess of the creation. The crunch of the house made chips countered what could have been a redundant texture but saved the day to make this a complex and satisfying starter.

Next for both of us:  Death by Gumbo
I'd had this dish on a previous visit to Restaurant R'evolution and it is why I returned. I have much love for this dish. The gumbo is intense.....and it is certainly not traditional.  The presentation is interesting as well.  A covered bowl is placed before me....then the cover is lifted to reveal a single quail that has been deboned and stuffed with yummy things....(rice, sausage, etc.).  Then the strained ""gumbo"" liquid is poured from a small little pitcher over the quail, coating it with pure intensified flavor. Gah. So good. That quail has a crispy skin and the meat is tender and delicious.  The fillings bring the comforting flavor of dirty rice and sausage expertly combined to make one composed exquisite bite. I seriously wanted to lick the bowl.

Entree - we split something that was not on the menu (sorry) but I'll do my best to describe the dish. I want to mention, though, how much we appreciate the care the chef took in making sure we both had a perfectly composed dish.  We each had a bit of all components:  seared scallops, foie gras, duck confit ravioli, and micro greens in a delicate broth.  Outstanding.  It was balanced in flavors and textures.  I am pretty certain had we each ordered it we would not have been able to finish but divided between us it was the perfect amount for tasting. The dish was exciting, interesting, and entertaining....food peeps, you'll get that.  Sorry if that sounds like food-snobbery. Shake it off.

Dessert, which is a priority of mine, was next on my agenda.
1. Louisana citrus doberge w/Meyer Lemon Curd, Creole Cream Cheese Ice Cream, Honeycomb
There is that doberge cake again!  (Referencing another review) The stand out for this dessert was the meyer lemon curd because it brought moisture and pucker to what could have been a cake a smidge on the dry side....the cream cheese ice cream was my husband's fave and the honeycomb was a lovely addition. 
2. Burnt honey ice cream.  My husband ordered this and it was ME who fell in love with it. The salt on top made me want more and more.  I loved the sweet/seemingly caramel flavor of the cream, too.....and just when you think you've had enough, the salt kicks in and you crave another nibble. They know what they are doing.

At the conclusion of this meal, my husband pulled out his phone and cancelled the reservations he made at another place for the next night and reserved a table for us at Restaurant R'evolution again.  Soooo if you are interested in knowing what we had for meal deux, I'm happy to send it your way. It was charcuterie night!  I'll add the picture as a tease.....",2021-10-17 00:43:31 UTC,5,1,0,3,4ewbSP31LF5defBxzyp_-Q

Goodland Goleta is $175/night, free parking and free wifi, which was nice. We stayed here because we like the Kimpton chain and have stayed at the Kimpton Canary in downtown Santa Barbara. The Canary was over $500/night plus parking, so we thought we would try Goodland, since it's only a 10 minute drive. 

As the saying goes, you pay for what you get. The sheets had stains, the room was not dirty, but not clean either. There were stains on the tables, sheets and towels. The tub is old, ceiling in the bathroom is cracked, just yucky. Felt a little gross. 

One VERY big complaint- housekeeping knocked on our door TWICE before checkout (12:00). They knocked about 8:30am and AGAIN at 10:00am. So annoying. They were right outside our door for at least 20 minutes after we told them we did not want cleaning, talking loudly and the bin was DIRECTLY outside our door so we couldn't leave the room to grab a coffee until they left.  Not sure if they are rude or oblivious.

The Kimpton Goodland has been on my list for a long while. However the photos just didn't line up with the reality or culture of the property. The service from more than one employee was subpar, and at times, borderline insulting. We were asked rudely to get up from more than one common area and never offered the opportunity to sit, stay and order food. In fact, at one point I had to ask if it was even a possibility to order food while sitting in the restaurant! The pool attendant barked at me when I asked if there were any towels and then said I could fetch them myself at the front desk. Upon entering the pool, we noticed that the water was dirty and had a film floating on the surface so much so that if one touched the edge, the film was sticky on the hands. The rooms were full of ants and the panels on the floors were peeling up and hazardous. The restaurant, bar and pool service were closed on Labor Day, one of the busiest travel days of the year. After waiting 30 min for our breakfast order, the host 'accidentally' gave it to another patron and did not offer a single concession. Disappointed is how we felt after this stay.

Definitely experienced neck and shoulder pain after the first night, so we asked for firmer pillows but whatever they brought up wasn't any improvement. Second, they only sell fancy $4 sparkling water in the lobby, so we had to go to the gas station at 6am to get bottled water. Finally , neither parking nor breakfast are Included in the room rate.

Got here late after midnight. Was hoping for a good night's rest until close to noon to continue our trip. Rudely woken up at 7:33am when a guy knocked, said ""Housekeeping"" and right away opened the door. He saw me in bed and backed out. But he didn't fully lock the door because I didn't hear a click. So I had to get up to push the door shut. 

Here's why this is so disturbing:
-our big blue ""do not disturb"" sticker was and still is on the door,
-who does housekeeping this effin early?!
-I'd looked out and nobody had a housekeeping cart in front. My husband didn't see any when he came back 10 minutes later;
-when I looked out a second time I saw a woman with a cart, not a guy;
-my husband told me that he had left to take the dog out just a few minutes right before this had happened, it seems all TOO coincidental and targeted!
-when I called the front desk right after, all the guy said was ""sorry to hear, anything else I can help you with. "" Well that was helpful. 

I couldn't even feel safe until my husband had come back and we put the extra lock on. Whatever good impression I've had would not make me return when I couldn't even feel safe to sleep in the room.

The floors need rugs, the rooms were very cold and if you don't have socks, your feet will freeze.  
The bathroom doors don't lock which wouldn't work well if you were staying with friends.  
The rooms are small, the online photos are deceiving.  
The pool area was great, but they really do need a jaccuzzi.  We went in December, and the pool was sort of warm, but not warm enough to be able to sit in for a while and enjoy.  
Rooms have teeny, tiny fridge and need a microwave.
The showers don't have doors, which doesn't make for a very warm shower.

Things that were great about the hotel are:
The beds were very comfortable.  
Black out curtains were amazing and kept all sunlight out.  
Landscaping was beautiful, design is up to date and so welcoming.
Staff was kind and helpful.

I always stay here but lately things seem to be going down hill as far as this place goes.  I made my reservation months in advance, asked for a certain room but was told those rooms were off limits due to Covid.  I get there on the day of my reservation, check in and I take a walk, only to find that those rooms are in fact occupied. 

My tv remote did not work, my lamp did not work, the faucets were corroded, the clock in the room was broken, not to mention that the bed is as hard as a rock and the pillows suck.  All of  this would not be bad but every time that I stay here it is the same thing, I can't get the room I want and something is always broken.  I guess they don't check to make sure everything is in order before booking the next guest.  

I pay a lot of money to stay here and I usually stay at least 3 days.  The last time I was here I stayed for a whole week.   I give this place one star because the location is good and the staff is always willing to help.  The problem is, I should not always have to ask for their assistance.  I really can't recommend this place and suggest that you find someplace that has better facilities.  Just because you place an old record player in the room doesn't mean you should let everything else go to shit.  By the way, I wrote to the manager yesterday and still have not heard back.  I hope to hear back from management soon and get at least an apology if not some money back.  I plan to return to Goleta soon but won't stay here again if things don't change.

I'll close by saying another nice thing about this place.  They are pet friendly and that is great because I don't travel without my little dog.

Update: it's been almost two weeks since my (another) bad experience at Kimpton Goodland Goleta and still no word from management. I already booked my next stay in town. Elsewhere. 

It's now been over one month and I've not heard one word from the hotel manager. Classless and pathetic treatment of an unhappy guest.",2021-04-19 23:27:36 UTC,1,0,0,3,KrjF3y7OC9lef3YNZCHMWA

I did not know that if dogs are left alone in a room, unattended by their owners, and they bark all the time, and the owners don't do anything about it, that the Hotel does not really enforce any rules and the actual victims, us in that case, have to move to a ""lower"" grade room, with a view on the parking lot. 
No managers on site, poor front desk customer relation experience, all they were trained to do is ""We're sorry"". 

The place is an old motel quickly patched with a few items here and there, but nothing fancy. Ok there is a Surfer theme in the lobby, but it stops right there. A car outside, a trailer, and then? 

You have a yoga mat in your bedroom, big deal ! Where are you going to do Yoga? In the parking lot? There is no view, you're by the road? You want to breath ""your heart"" around kids playing ""Marco Polo"" or dogs who might gave peed on the lawn?

The only people who would enjoy this hotel are dogs owners who cannot travel without their dogs (for many different reasons, mostly because they need their pacifier). 
I think leaving your dogs in an unfamiliar room locked up, unattended is selfish and irresponsible, especially when you are told your dogs are disturbing others. 
I think bringing your dog to a restaurant is also selfish ; torturing his/her natural enhanced sense with all the food around the tables and other dogs  they cannot interact with. For what? 
How about cats? Isn't this discriminatory? Should I bring my piglet  or my dwarf pony? Why not? 

It's definitely not a 4 star hotel, closer to 3 or even less. Charging more than $500 a night on a week-end is simply abusive.

We paid about $315 per night plus tax and fees for a room with 2 double beds.  I don't often take time to write reviews but I felt that this was necessary for a few reasons listed below. I spoke with the front desk about the condition of the room upon checkout and was told someone from management would contact me but I've heard nothing. 

The bad: 
- The room needs some LOVE. Its obvious that this was a renovated motel dressed up with some cute styling. That would be fine except there were glaring maintenance issues that make this room worth nowhere near $300+ per night.  The laminate floors are cracked and peeling up in many places, with sharp corners that scratch your feet.
-our room looked out to a lovely view of the parking lot. 
-The door between the bedroom and bathroom is an opaque piece of glass that leaves a 1 inch gap when ""closed"". There's very little privacy (or blocking sound and smells) between the 2 rooms. 
-The comforter had no duvet cover. It was a bare comforter sandwiched between 2 flat sheets. This is a pretty big cleanliness issue in a hotel setting. 
-The website promises some cute touches. One of them is a record player in every room. Ours was nowhere to be found. In fact the room was pretty bare overall. 
-All of the cute activities like pool deck yoga and such are cancelled right now due to covid

The good: 
-The restaurant is great. We ate there a few times and loved the cocktails, entrees, and yummy brunch with live music. 
-Common spaces are stylish accurate to the website photos
- You get a beer upon arrival
-Nice pool, with pool service on the weekends. 

TLDR; This hotel charges a lot. The room was poor quality with ripped up floors. Restaurant is good. Overall, not worth the money. Brought up issues to management upon checkout and never heard from them.",2021-08-27 03:54:53 UTC,1,0,0,4,PcUExWSzot6UI9_FMkWjkg

Had to stay in Santa Barbara for a wedding being hosted at this hotel. Online the photos are super nice and you think okay this MIGHT be worth the money. We paid over $1,000 for 2 nights.

With that being said, I had a hard time swallowing the various shortcomings in this Kimpton hotel.

First, the record players, or I guess in this case, the lack thereof:

While the selection of records available for use throughout the hotel is awesome(they have anything from jazz classics to new wave hiphop), there is no point in having records available for borrowing if you can't play them. Many of the rooms aren't equipped with record players(even though it promises that they are), and even if you do get a room with one, theres a good chance that your record player wont work, as the front desk informed me of the many broken players. 

Second, the service, or (yet again) the lack thereof:

This is largely a product of the post-COVID travel boom, but if this is the case, Kimpton has no business going to full capacity. The hotel is severely understaffed, and at times, it really does seem like theres only one person working the hotel. This isn't fair to the staff (who clearly have too much on their plates) and its not fair to the guests. If you call the front desk, don't expect them to pick up, you will have to physically haul yourself over to the front desk yourself for your request. What's even worse is if you ask for a request, they wont deliver. Our room came without body wash and lotion, and while the front desk gave me body wash, they promised they would deliver lotion to our room, and of course, that didn't happen.

Third, the air conditioning, or lack thereof (noticing a theme here?).

This was the biggest disappointment to us. Obviously it was probably just our room with the faulty AC, but it sums up our stay, and this particular Kimpton perfectly. I know this isn't the case, but our stay made us really feel like the Kimpton didn't care about us at all. As long as we were paying guests, they were satisfied. It doesn't matter to them if the record players they promised are there or not, it doesn't matter to them if their guests get their cleaning supplies, and it doesn't matter to them if their guests are cared for and comfortable. Thats what it felt like here.

The bright spots of this hotel are as follows: Nice restaurant with high quality food and good service, the general hipster aesthetic(would be even better with working record players) and a nice pool where the guests can socialize and cool off. Aside from that, that's about it. I gave this hotel 3 stars instead of two because at least the front desk people were nice. They didn't or couldn't follow through, but they were nice.",2021-07-11 18:46:51 UTC,3,1,0,3,RX4rKXBvmCyzheXJ65YxoQ

To keep this as short as possible: We requested early check-in when we made the reservation on their site and called the night before to verify.  When we got there at 12:30, we were told they ""would try"" to get us into our room by 4 (the regular check in time). We explained we needed to get into the room to get ready for our  son's commencement at 3:30. The response? ""I don't know who you talked to last night but early check in is not a guarantee."" 

We checked back several times over the next two plus hours - nothing. It was clear that she never checked with her manager, never called housekeeping,  never offered us an alternative room. (The hotel was half full.)  We wound up taking our suitcases into the restrooms and changing in a stall. I have never seen such indifference to a customer's problem before.

3. Vibey decor - cute, 70s retro style decorations
4. Restaurant - food was decent albeit a Iittle pricey but hey its a hotel, what do you expect? 
5. Unique amenities - Yoga mat  (I think they used to have classes pre-covid as well although now idk where you would do Yoga since the room is too small ), record player (with rentable vinyls in the lobby), dog poop bags throughout the building, cute striped robes
6. Location - 15 min drive to Santa Barbara/State Street, close to Albertsons + Trader Joes grocery stores
7. Dog relief area - although it is small and there is a big tree in the middle of it, it worked well for my dog



THE BAD
1. Inconsistent rooms - our first room had a shower with a half door and the drain was super slow. There was no record player. Walls were chipped and there were holes in the floor as described earlier. When we moved to our second room,  it was a bathtub with a shower curtain (which I preferred) but there was still no record player or robes so we had to carry them over from our old room. Other inconsistencies: A/C unit was wall controlled for one room and the other was on the unit itself. Different hand soaps and pens (not a big deal but kind of odd?)
2. Tiny gym - as of Sept 2021, there are no more free weights in the gym despite there being a bench in there. There are a few cardio machines in there as well. 
3. Old/outdated building - this is a revamped motel so expect to see some older rooms that have not been fully remodeled. 
4. Bathroom door - The bathroom sliding door is also opaque so if someone is going to the bathroom at night, all the light shines through and will wake up the other person.
5. Bedding - Pillows were lumpy and didn't fit into their pillow cases. The comforter didn't have a cover which was a little odd to me. Instead, it was a comforter sandwiched between two bed sheets
6. Loud - Our first room was one with adjoining doors and we could hear the kids/babies shouting next door. Our second room did not have adjoining rooms thank goodness!
7. Questionable trash cans - no bag lining on any of the trash cans or bins in the room. Just seems kinda unsanitary to me.
8. Expensive - to me, this place is definitely priced a lot higher than it should be. 

Overall, it was an okay stay but nothing that blew me away. Honestly, the old feel of the rooms outweighed the ""cool"" picturesque decor and service. The pictures on the website and marketing definitely make it look nicer than it is. I didn't feel like I was getting my money's worth by staying here and probably won't be returning the next time I am in Santa Barbara.",2021-09-13 18:54:14 UTC,3,0,0,1,KOe378UsLxr7GrNhfgKZcw

I have never left any hotel reservation early but this place made me do it. I'll get straight to the point. 

1. Tiny little rooms 
2. Paper thin wall 
3. Our neighbor was on the from 2:30 am to 5:30 talking on speaker phone without any consideration for others. 
4. I tried calling customer service to report issue in the middle of the night. The phone just rang and rang. Non existing customer service (24hrs?).

Worse, when I attempted to inform the staff I found out the hotel phones were not functioning at all. The ""emergency"" button on the phone? Useless. When I did go down to inform the front desk, expecting at least some degree of sympathy and possibly something as small and a comped coffee or water bottle, or anything, I was literally asked, as the very first question after explaining my horrific ordeal, ""would you like your receipt printed or via email?""

From the decor to the extremely friendly and attentive staff (even though they are very busy) everything about this place made us smile! Our room was adorable and the pool was so much fun for me and my daughter! The whole place gives Palm Springs vibes (without the heat) and is the perfect weekend getaway spot. This place is underrated. It's sad because people rarely go on Yelp to write about their good experiences and this place deserves more kudos. Also, the food is AMAZING. We ate at the pool both days and had the breakfast before leaving. The pool server, I believe her name is Savanah, was so sweet and recommended the pork sliders and watermelon salad which both had crazy amazing flavor ( she also brought a little umbrella for my 4 yr old daughter who was jealous of our mixed drink decorations, just one example of the staff caring and taking pride in their work).

Great place we will be back!  We ended up here by accident...we booked a room at another hotel in a very sketchy area of town based on the rate and pictures on Booking.com...
My wife and I left and headed to Goodland to check out the property.  What a difference, we went into the front desk, they had a room available.  Very cute and kitschy venue!  They have an old Ford ""Woody"" wagon and Airstream trailer out front.  The staff offered us a really good & delicious Pilsner Beer from Captain Fatty's Brewery (local brewery-see my review for that) that even my wife liked!!

Our room was tastefully decorated and very clean!!  Our bed was comfortable and they had a working record player in the room with records...only bummer the speakers didn't work very well

The entire time we were there, we had to keep the A/C on cool at 66 as the room never fully was cool/cooled off. I talked to other guests on our floor and they had similar complaints. Again, the room never fully cooled off and we had to keep the darkening shade down daily to try and keep the room somewhat tolerable. At 66 on high cooling/AC the room should have been freezing, at best it might have cooled off to 75.

Also, we asked for fresh towels daily and each afternoon getting back to the room, they were not there. We then always had to find cleaning personnel and ask for it that way. (Why request it when we then have to find someone and hunt them down for towels.)

This hotel needs major renovation to their heating/cooling units as well as more staff to attend to guests needs. Not worth the price, it was more like staying at a budget hotel/motel vs. Kimpton brand.",2021-07-14 17:27:30 UTC,2,0,0,3,23sAtG_q6Yw-Je3-rA-Bbw

The room size is ok, bed is comfy, there are some vintage decors that are interesting. However, couple of things really discounted the experience- 

1. The room is not sound proof in any way. You can hear people whispering outside your door. You can hear your neighbors flushing the toilet at night and taking a shower. There is no privacy at all.
2. Windows cannot open so no fresh air at any point. Also no fan in the bathroom. If you have the door open for the air the people walking by can see your entire room.
3. The TV and remote is so old and it requires you to get really close to the TV in order for the remote to work. So you'd have to get up from your bed if you are laying down, get really close to the monitor to change a channel.
4. Feels like a road side motel that is upgraded with a nice clean bed. But nothing more.


Suggestion to management - instead of spending money only on decor, maybe upgrade the TV, our bathroom fan or windows instead for solid guest experience.",2021-06-18 13:35:23 UTC,2,0,0,1,TZWWDwUoXS0iexCYMEZaQQ

I will say we did stop into the Terrance Osborne gallery and the artist himself happened to walk in right when we got there. Even Mark looked starstruck as us lol! He was so sweet he went over his different art work and gave us a little tour of the gallery. It was an added bonus to an already wonderful tour.

We walked to the meeting spot and were a few minutes late but our guide Ty was understanding and began right away. It was overcast and very chilly the entire tour. Unfortunately, Lafayette Cemetery 1 was closed for renovations but we still enjoyed learning so much standing right outside the gate. The cemetery was my husband's favorite part. There were other tour groups passing through as well so there was some overlap, but we were the only ones with Ty so it was intimate and allowed for more questions and side conversation. Toward the end of our time at Lafayette No. 1, what seemed to be a group of punk thrill-seekers started asking Ty questions about the closed cemetery and Lafayette 2 so I started slowly walking away so as not to have our guide absconded and Ty quickly caught on. Pretty early on, our little one was bored but was very well-behaved regardless. At one point it seemed I was having a one-on-one tour, which I actually wouldn't have minded hah. I really should've taken more photos but it was difficult to break away and snap them while Ty spoke because I was too focused on the history. Ty really has a wealth of knowledge and knows her stuff. She pretty much had the answers to all of our questions. We walked through the Garden District and it was very beautiful, informative, curious, and at times, funny. Along with tons of historical facts, Ty will throw in an interesting fun fact or relevant ironic joke, making the tour more enjoyable and personable. There were so many questions I had, some not even completely formed yet. I wish the tour could've gone on longer, covering more of the district. Being an Anne Rice and AHS fan, this tour really hit my cravings for history and piqued my interest in learning more about the district and NOLA in general. During this time of COVID, we all had to wear masks during the tour and there was tons of street construction happening, but we still had a very enjoyable time. We will definitely be taking other tours of theirs during future visits (without young children).

Given it's location -- restaurants, bars and other areas of interest are all within walking distance. They have friendly staff members but they don't seem to care much about the suggestions given from the guests to improve the property as I asked about our room on the first night and didn't hear anything back, day 2 or day 3.

With that being said, the AC units in these rooms are anything but clean. This provided minimal air functionality which prevented the room from cooling even into the night. Asked about fans and they did not have any on hand. The sheets on one of the beds had what looked like a dried blood stain so that bed went unused. Lastly the bathroom water takes a while to heat and changes temperatures.

Pros:
1- It is a very cool looking hotel and fun design. Each room is named after a jazz musician and there is memorabilia everywhere. It's older, and it wouldn't hurt for them to update some of the structure. The steps , fences, walkways are falling apart. Really bad tripping hazards...
2- There are two pools (they're small and there's only 4 chairs and one table at each... but two pools nonetheless.)
3- The lobby is clean and the staff is friendly/professional. 

Cons: 
1- It is D.I.R.T.Y. Everything from the towels to the fan to the floors were dirty. I couldn't stomach taking photos. Our first set of bath towels in the room had makeup stains on them. We exchanged them at the front desk...the new ones also had stains. The bed sheets didn't look OR feel clean, and there were many hairs/stains throughout them as well. The pillows were so discolored and flat. The fan was caked in dust, and there was a fingernail in our trash can! 
2- The air conditioning hardly works... we had it set to 64 to try and cool it down and the coolest the place got was 77. When it's basically total humidity that is too, too warm. 
3- They ran out of water in the lobby snack bar...that was just silly. Shouldn't have happened. 
4- We came for a bachelorette this past weekend (requested rooms side by side but were split upon arrival.) They actually had us fairly far apart, which was a little buzzkill and why we called in advance to prevent it from happening. 

We loved the city and would like to come back, but unfortunately we would not stay here again. Especially since it was NOT a cheap stay.",2021-07-27 03:25:15 UTC,2,2,1,6,ewMENbNhw1eOXLUDiqLy7Q

Upon arrival we were allowed to check in an hour and a half before check in time started so I was grateful for that but that ended up being the only positive thing about our stay here. I checked in on Friday June 11th and upon entering the room we realized the AC unit and TV were not working so we brought it to the hotel staffs attention and were told they were going to contact someone to check on the AC because it was over 90 degrees outside so a room with a nonfunctional AC unit was going to make for an extremely uncomfortable stay. We went out for the day and when we returned we were told that a technician would be coming out the next morning (Saturday June 12th) we were very patient and understanding and even accepted a box and industrial fan for the night even though all that did was blow hot air around the room. The next morning we had a reservation to make it to and we trusted that the hotel staff would keep their word. We left at 7am and returned at 4pm and the AC unit was still not working. Not a single staff member communicated to us that they weren't actually able to get someone out to look at the unit until Monday morning. We had to go speak with them in order to receive that information. On top of the AC unit not working when we returned on Saturday we noticed that the mini fridge in the room was also no longer working so we had nothing to keep our drinks cool in this extremely hot and uncomfortable room. Management offered to pay for a room at another hotel at 6pm as we were leaving for our 6:10 ride (we had multiple reservations to make it to and had no time to look for another room to stay in and move around.) We left again for our evening plans and things just got worse. Again, we returned to more issues. We got back around midnight and upon entering the room our the ceiling fan was hanging by wires (see attached photos). Hotel staff had to get maintenance back on site to take a look at it. Side note the maintenance employee Mario was literally the only person who showed genuine concern for us during this situation and was the only one attempting to be helpful. After about an hour and a half of him talking to his manager he was able to get us out into another room which also did not have a functioning AC unit. They ended up now placing 3 fans in the room for us to sleep in uncomfortably. I spoke with the a man named Brett who is part of their management team and he could not care less about our awful experience at their hotel. I asked for a refund and was told the most they could do was not charge us for the night where the ceiling fan had fallen and give us a 25% discount for the previous night (which he did not do, he still charged us full price). The only reason Brett offered to not charge us for the second night was because we had fallen asleep in the lobby trying to cool down and waiting on them to find a solution for the fire hazard that we returned to. I feel as though giving us a refund was the absolute least they could do considering everything we had to endure at this hotel. I suffered from heat exhaustion because my body was never able to cool down properly, coming from the heat outside to the heat inside. I booked this hotel for the rustic feel and experience of the city and was extremely disappointed with how the situation was handled. My birthday weekend was ruined due to the unsafe conditions at this hotel. To add to everything else Brett had the audacity to ask that we keep our experience off of social media. This whole situation could have been handled so much better than it was and I hope no one else has to experience a weekend like we did.",2021-06-13 20:01:45 UTC,1,0,0,0,psrU76kXkpZDUNivc3uczA

Had to fly my mother to Tampa urgently due to a dying sibling. Had to get her there a few days earlier than planned. Dollar would not help adjust her reservation dates, so she rented from another company for the extra days. Went back on the originally scheduled day. 26 people in line, 1 employee and over an hour wait. Then the agent berates her because she did not understand having to put down an extra $200 on a pre-paid rental. Chewing out an old lady - nice. Today, she gets up before 4am to make a flight home and the car is completely dead. Does anyone answer the customer support line? No. So she leaves the car at my family's home and my now-widowed aunt had to wake up and drive her so she would not miss her flight. I have tried to get customer support to alert them and have them pick up the car, but it's been over 20 minutes of roadside assistance hold music so far. This is not customer service. This isn't any kind of service. I will never use Dollar again ever. What a terrible way to run a business. And I know we are still in pandemic mode but the other rental companies at Tampa Intl Airport were well-staffed and my mother had zero issues renting from Enterprise the day she arrived at their counter without a reservation and in a hurry.

Find a different rental car company, because Dollar will add charges to your rental without your consent. We said no to the insurance and had it added anyways which was a nearly 200$ charge.

The day came to return the car and we were told it would've had to be handled within 30 minutes .

Not sure where the original hotel ended  the new(er) rooms were added but all rooms are named after a jazz musician.  We visited on 8/18 thru 8/22/21 and had a great time.  This is our second time in Nola and second time staying here- we like it!  The building is old, the exteriors are old, but the rooms are freshened up and if you want 5 Star amenities- do yourself & go book a $400/night room at the Sheraton.  This is OLD TOWN, this IS The French Quarter.  We came for the old feel and that is exactly what we got.  

Being that Covid is on it's second 'up-swing' there was no continental breakfast but there was coffee in the lobby, and that's almost as good as breakfast, right?  Our room was #206 and it was nice & spacious, nice sized bathroom, Super Comfy King Bed, nice down pillows.  The door lock was a bit 'suspect' as the deadbolt wasn't working but the doorlock worked and there was a chain.  And also- the courtyard gate is locked from 9Pm to 9am (with key access, of course).  Our room was on the other side of the street as the lobby, no pools on that side but 2 cute courtyards, and one hosted a small wedding when we were there.  CONGRATS GUYS!!!  

Our first stay was in one of the smaller rooms, lobby side, back by the 2nd pool.  Just enough room in there to turn around, just enough room in the bathroom to shower but don't try to dry yourself in the shower, or in the bathroom, for that matter.  BUT, that room was the CHEAPEST they had.  You pay a little more, you get MUCH more.  With Covid and them being short staffed- the rooms weren't serviced regularly.  No worries, we cleaned up after ourselves and got fresh linens at the lobby.

I would like to have given them 4.5 Stars, but with Covid and how the hotel industry is dying now, 5 is my score.",2021-08-23 17:17:25 UTC,5,1,1,1,x9iuAGli8uK8ucK8zbRwRw

Being an older hotel does not excuse lack of cleaning. Our room was a little grubby as others have noted, and they are rationing out how often they service the rooms using COVID-19 as an excuse. Give me a break. Actually a lot of hotels are pulling this lame trick now as it saves them money on housekeeping staff. COVID-19 is airborne/ droplet, not surface contact, hence all the masks for the last year and a half. Housekeeping staff are no more at risk from catching or spreading the disease by cleaning hotel rooms than anyone else in any job where there's contact with other people. There's also no coffee or breakfast in the lobby like there used to be pre pandemic. So essentially you're paying the same price for your room yet receiving fewer services. It's such BS, how stupid do hotels think we are? ... changing bed linens is no more high risk than checking guests in at a busy main desk.
That said this hotel is quaint,  charming, well located and we experienced no street noise. No elevators so unsuitable for disabled.  Staff were friendly. We provided them with a list of things that needed to be fixed in our room (loose hooks, TV not working, needed service) and when we got back to our room 8 hours later they had not attended to any of them. Ugh! We asked the front desk why not, and got some nonsense response. Well by then I really needed a bath and behold, they chose that precise moment to send a guy into the room to clean it. Whilst I was in the tub. Not cool.
The parking situation is there is no parking (well they have like 5 spots.) So you have to park in a public lot 10 mins walk away, to the tune of $30 per day. This is not unique to this hotel, you'll find the same setup in all the hotels in the French Quarter,  there ain't much space. Honestly if you're in town for a few days  it's probably best to just fly into New Orleans and uber to the hotel, you won't use your car whilst you're there anyway.

I would go back because the irritating niggly things I described are common to most hotels in NOLA:  if you want spotless cookie cutter,  you'll have to go to a Hampton Inn or something. I wish they'd just clean the effing rooms and quit with the laziness BUT I've seen a million other reviews from a hundred different hotels in French Quarter all complaining about the same thing sooooo, clearly hotel managers don't give a rat's. Cuz if they're all dirty, then your dirty-ass hotel is just one more filthy place in a long line of fleapits and then who cares, right. Basically these old hotels are all somewhat dirty and funky just like New Orleans. And, If you can't handle that you probably shouldn't be here.

First, they lost the car when the tow truck driver delivered it to Sarasota Airport (not my problem) and Dollar feels I should have driven the broken down car to Tampa airport to exchange it despite being in Bradenton for a wedding.  I am forced to dispute this on my charge card.  Avoid this car company. 

DO NOT rent their cars. Started with a one hour wait to pick up my reserved car.  They only had one employee.  Rented a midsize for a 4 day rental. On the 2nd day, the low tire pressure came on. After checking, 2 of the tires had only 27 PSI, no wonder it was riding rough. Drove from Tampa to Bradenton for a wedding (45 minute trip). Stopped to pee and the car was dead. Nothing, battery dead, so the alternator was obviously not charging the battery while we were driving.

2 hour ordeal on the phone with Dollar and roadside assistance. Left on hold for 30 minutes. Finally got an escalation.  Here are the options they gave us:
- Get a jump, no guarantee the car would start again. PASS
- get to our destination and leave the car running. Seriously, a 7 hour wedding/reception and the car will be there when I get back? PASS
- Have a tow truck pick us and the car up to drive to the TAMPA airport to pick up another car and then drive back in time to miss the wedding. Ah, no, PASS.
- Have a tow truck come and take the car back to TPA and terminate our agreement with Dollar.  No care or concern for abandoning us in Bradenton.  SADLY, this was our best option to actually get to the wedding and divorce us from the drama with Dollar rental.

So the tow truck gets to us at 2 hours of waiting, he wants to jump the car - Hell NO! He had no idea he was picking up the car. 20 minutes later, the tow truck driver has secured the car and we called an Uber driver to get to the CHURCH ON TIME.

Overall, this car showed and absolute LACK OF MAINTENANCE.  How dare they give me a car with no basic service or maintenance.

There was less than 1/3 roll of toilet paper left and when I went to flush the chain in the toilet tank was unhooked. I had to put my hand in there to fix it to flush the toilet!

I was told that there was nothing they could do over the phone, I was told that I would have to be there to pick up the car and I could add my husband then. When I got there not only did I have to wait in a long line as they only had one person behind the counter but I had to wait for them to locate the car. Regardless I explained to the gentleman behind the counter which needed no explanation as I was in a wheel chair and holding crutches that since I could not drive that I would need to add my husband to the vehicle and he said that wod not be a problem and due to my situation they would waive any fees associated to that since it was apparent that I would not be driving. When we got to the car not only was it banged up but it was also dirty. Ordinarily I would have gone back in  and tell them that is unexceptable but I was to tired so took it and had the car professionally detailed before my trip. Now fast forwarding to the drop off. Everything was fine and the car was dropped off in better condition then what I received it in. When the car was dropped off we were told everything was good and we would get our receipt in our email. Not only did I not get my final receipt but when I hacked my card they over charged me and added $140 and change so I called them and they said that it was for adding a driver.

I do love the friendliness of the TSA folks here unlike Dulles.  

Dulles airport is amazingly designed and you're watched like a hawk with lots of police and dogs around.  Their folks aren't half a nice and it's just a place you wanna get out of without issues. That was back in 2017 so hopefully they're better.  BWI and Reagan National is closer to DC and they aren't as bad at all.

We landed and departed from the very end of terminal B.  Long, but nice walk with glass the entire side so we could look out on airplanes.  Ample and CLEAN restrooms!
I was pleased to see all the restaurant and food offerings here as well as the (over priced) gift shops that had everything you didn't buy on Bourbon Street. No wait for a taxi (fixed rate $36) to French Quarter.  Taxi took about 30 minutes due to construction in the French Quarter.
For my flight out, I was pleased MSY has both Clear and TSA PreCheck.  I went right towards the Clear cluster and had my eyes scanned and was escorted to the front of the TSA Pre Check line and the officer looked at my boarding card and waved me on.  I wasn't in a rush, but this saved probably 10 minutes. After security, I headed to The Club at MSY.  If you have Priority Pass, it is a great alternative to waiting at the gate.  It is small though& by the time I exited, they were turning people away.
I perused Cafe du Monde and really wanted to bring home some mix as a gift, but, I didn't want to schlep it.  It was just $5.99.  They didn't jack their prices for the airport. Then I moved on to a gift shop in Terminal B that had knickknacks.  Nothing grabbed my eye, plus my roll aboard was already bulging.
My flight was leaving out of B-14 and I was happy to see every couple seats had charging stations!

Significant step down from what was.

Sure the inside of the airport is nicer, though you have to walk a half mile to everything.  Sure a better selection of food, compared to one place to eat in the old Southwest terminal, at the old airport...

But logistically this place is a nightmare...

The separate routes for arrivals and departures...  not good

Temperature control in the airport...  always cold, not good.

Layout from start to finish is awful...  what's with all the walking?  The ticketing is spread out in a very odd way, and a lot of wasted space.  Same goes for the checked luggage-lower level.

I could go on and on, but another notable point, there is no awning or protection from the elements at the departures & arrivals drop offs.  Did anyone give any thought to, it rains 75% of the time here and what to do when dropping off passengers in the rain?...

Again, old airport was better.

Landing and coming back home into our bright and airy new airport is such an improvement from the old arrival experience. It has a much more contemporary vibe than the old MSY and makes me proud to be a local. Playing on our local theme of music, the reminder to sing a Louis Armstrong song while washing your hands also made me smile. 

Hats off also to the increased food options...it's a great blend of local food brands like City Greens and MoPho along with popular food brands like Starbucks and Shake Shack. I personally skip the Starbucks in favor of our hometown PJs coffee but am glad to see the increased range of options than what we have before. 

I totally get why we were ranked #1 in customer satisfaction by JD Power Associates!! (And we achieved the highest score in Food & Beverage and Retail factor!)

This one was no different.  The new and improved version is a lot nicer.
They keep it clean and the restrooms are good.
Most of the food places are closed, unfortunately.
The TSA line was LONG even though the place was not busy.  So we were stuck in the line for about 25 min because they had very few people working the TSA checkpoint.
The checkpoint was efficient once we got there.
If New Orleans is going to pretend to care about COVID, its incredibly irresponsible for the airport to cram several hundred people (at least 300 -350) in a cattle maze line that zigs and zags in close proximity to itself.  This is a large airport yet they cram everyone in a tiny space to wait for a very long line that is needlessly long, while other parts of the airport have staff sitting around looking at their shoes.  There are some nice food choices when they are open.
PS don't buy your pralines there they are 3x the price on the makers website, same with the cajun spice, that they sell at Walmart for $2.48 a can.

With that being said, landing here was a breeze. Luggage was easy to find, and the process of calling a ride share was easy.

On my way out of New Orleans, heading back to Philly, we were a bit more crunched for time. We left with plenty of time for luggage drop off and security lines, however our driver had no sense of urgency. There was a significant amount of traffic on the way to the airport, but it seemed that most of it was not even for cars traveling to the airport. I'm not sure if this is normal, and probably should have asked local friends, but I'd plan to spend a bit of time in traffic on the way.

Our Spirit check-in area and luggage drop off did not have a single working scale so we were left to hope (and pray) that our suitcases did not gain too much weight during our trip. The line was very long, but moved quickly. The same goes for the security line. It appears there was one security line for the entire airport, so of course this was massive. I was surprised to see the display of how many guns had been recovered by TSA during 2021 alone. I was even more surprised to see the pictures of each individual gun. I'm not entirely sure this works as a deterrent, but I also am not one bring a firearm to an airport so I'm not the target demographic for that one.

Once we were through the long, but rapidly moving security line, we had about 30 minutes before our flight was scheduled to take off. Luckily (for us) it was running pretty behind, so I had time to stop at the Chili's To-Go counter to order some chicken crispers and queso. While this might not be the peak of my dining experiences in New Orleans, it was worth every penny. Five stars for Chili's To-Go.",2021-12-28 14:44:27 UTC,4,12,6,10,qsQx9FrGcZ7y1Hgrp_RPvw

Only source of food and drink are the kiosks. It's like walking through a blighted neighborhood. Perhaps airport authority has set rent too high. 

Power outage at airport cancelled partner's flight. Had to pick up car days later due to airport still being without power. Airport was constructed just a few years ago and it is unbelievable that it has to close due to a storm. Had to pay $4 to drop my partner off in the parking garage even though I didn't park and I only entered the parking structure because they cancelled partner's flight. Sorry service.

On to the overall parking situation. Economy parking is literally one airport over and you have to use uncomfortable (dirty, no suspension) shuttles back and forth. Parking levels (short term, economy, long term, etc.) costs are not marked nor does it say anywhere what the costs are until you are at the parking structure at which time you are committed as there is no way to turnaround. 

The entrance to the airport is third world like in all regards and outright dangerous but apparently an actual road is being constructed. Looks like it will be ready in 2023.

I repeat do not ever travel through this airport with a disaster going on! You will be left on your own especially as out of towners to deal with the chaos and lack preparedness. I am shocked and appalled after Katrina local officials have not put in place safe guards to keep order and etc.

I was traveling through this airport right before hurricane Ida hit. We were fortunate enough to find flights out on Saturday since our original flights were set to leave on Monday. I want also thank the people in New Orleans for advising our family to get the hack out of town. The news was always changing and was confusing. 

Our airlines would let us check our bags in until 4 hours before our flight. We were there almost 6 hours early because it was difficult to catch cabs to  the airport. 

First of all, the airport employees in purple shirts are no help at all! They really needed the national guard or cops there to help keep order. We did not know where the line began or end. Mind you we started on the 3rd floor but TSA is on the 2nd. It was so many people on the 2nd and 3rd it was over crowded during COVID-19. Mind you while all this happened the New Orleans Saints was escorted in through TSA with ample security to their private plane.

The TSA line took us a few hours. We thought hey eat some snacks now then when we get through the TSA line we could order some food at one of the restaurants or sky lounge. I was hoping for the hubby to finally try Cafe Du Monde. 

All of the restaurants were closed! There was only one store that sold souvenirs and snacks that was open. All of the cold sandwiches and yogurt were gone. Our only options were chips, water, pop, and protein bars. I want to truly thank those employees for staying and stocking the shelves!! While the other businesses closed early they stayed! I would like to add all of the vending machines were empty. 

I was shocked to see they had 3 machines in our close vencity. This airport does not have any grab & go kiosk stores. Which I am wondering why is this called an international airport and they do not have the resources or foresight to plan for hurricanes or tropical storms. Louisiana is not new to tropical weather or hurricanes. Nor did they adopt any policies after Katrina to ensure people are getting out safely. I witnessed lots of people arguing and literally stealing food from closed restaurants! It doesn't take science to move more vending machines in this airport during hurricane season. Or have the national guard on site to help those poor airport employees! 

It safe to say I will not be back for a long time! After almost being caught in storm that was worst than Katrina I will not be traveling there during their hurricane season or for a while. 

Don't tell me I could have drove! All of the rental car places did not have any cars left. The bus service to Houston was sold out.",2021-09-06 15:50:10 UTC,1,10,7,16,ZQflSPFJejj_UdI7wKw22g

The airport is sparsely occupied, everyone is wearing masks, double masks, and/or face shields. The seats have 6' reminders on them and I found plenty of room far away from others. I tend to like to socialize at the airport, it helps takes my mind off my flying fear, so it's slightly sad flying nowadays when you really can't make friends with strangers. Oh well!

An interesting visual to note while in line is two posterboards: one contained pictures of guns and accessories that the TSA had confiscated from 2021 and the other is a monthly calendar noting which days the firearms were found during check-in.  Other than these two posterboards, there was not much else to look at. The staff eventually opened up at least 2 more check-in areas.

I asked for an escort to bring my back through to go to the restroom.  I asked if I would be able to go back through security and go to the bathroom myself. I asked about 4 people to help me retrieve my phone and it wasn't looking like a good outcome. I walked up to a different police officer who was standing outside of the no entry and asked if he would be able to escort me to the bathroom to get my phone and he stated no he wouldn't escort me.

First of all- I felt it was really clean! You genuinely can't say that about many airports. It's got a lot of natural light because there are windows literally everywhere, and all the accents and furniture are white or lighter in color so I feel like it gives a good mood boost.

They have their gift shops set up kind of funny too- they aren't in actual pockets or stores, they're just almost like pop-up stands in the middle of the walkways that you can weave through.

Lastly, I was impressed by the variety and quality of food options in the airport. As you walked along there were plenty of restaurants that aren't your typical chains and all look cool in their own way because they're most unique and kind of modern cool. They even have an airport version of Cafe Du Monde to get one last beignet fix- which of course I hit up!!

Sometimes you dread going to certain airports or really don't know what to expect going to a new one. But I felt our trip was pretty smooth and easy.

Security gates took forever to go through.  Guess it's about staffing shortages.   But it wasn't this bad elsewhere we flew.  

Outside is a disaster.   Signage still terrible.  The police controlling traffic are mean. If you come to pick someone up and the driver is forced to go around again, you have to go clear to Loyola where you exit off the highway.  
It was raining and everyone was getting wet waiting for rides as there are no canopies to protect. 
Very confusing. My driver was on the inside lane and I was on the other side of the island.  
Is all this going to be fixed?",2021-06-29 03:41:38 UTC,2,0,0,0,ytsrNuARoSDI6pb6zzjBJg

After a complete overhaul in 2019 (#1), the current version of Louis Armstrong looks like the airport NOLA always deserved: modern, spacious, sleek, and versatile across the board.

Flying into the old MSY was loathsome; something I never looked forward to in all of my jaunts to Louisiana. Everything from the facilities to the horrendous food options made this place a nightmare to spend time in for delayed flights. With the newer version, it now has lounge access (United, Delta, Club MSY), fast WiFi, numerous dining options, more flights operating across the board, and plenty of space for programming opportunities (#2).

Everything from the check-in process (at least with JetBlue, Alaska, and Southwest) has been super easy. TSA is headache anywhere, but with the recent expansion there is less of a wait to get through the checkpoint. Food options are far more diverse now with well known chains like Shake Shack, Chick Fil A, Ye College Inn as well as local spots like Emeril's Table, Leah's Kitchen, and even Cafe DuMonde.

One thing that I don't like as much is the rental car situation. At least in the old iteration, it was just a small golf buggy / short walk away. Now, it's become like other airports where there is a shuttle involved and lots of waiting before departing to a ""nearby"" facility practically 15-20 min away.

I'm not saying MSY is the greatest airport in the world by any means, but given where they started, it's not hard to marvel at how far they've come along.

Eb1XmmLWyt_way5NNZ7-Pw,Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport  MSY,"Hotels & Travel, Airports, Transportation",Kenner,29.995874401400002,-90.2551640664,3,1789,AZ,"This airport opened in 1946 and was originally named Moisant Field after daredevil aviator John Moisant who died in a plane crash on the land that the airport is located. In 2001, the named of the airport was changed to The Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport in conjunction with what have been the jazz legends 100th birthday.

This airport serves New Orleans, but is located in the nearby cities of Kenner/Metairie, which is about 20 minutes away from New Orleans. It is a medium to small sized airport. It spans 1,500 acres. It consists of one sole terminal, with three concourses (A, B, & C) and 35 gates. I have flown in and out of here (the old terminal mostly)  many times over the years and this airport is constantly evolving and changing. 

The airport does offer a paid shuttle service from the airport to downtown.  Reservations for the shuttle is recommended.  There is also a city bus stop at the airport that can get you close to downtown as well, so if you packed light that may be an option.

The new terminal is awesome. It opened in 2019 and still has the new car smell. The Airport has free Wifi and tons of phone charging stations scattered around the airport. They also have water bottle filling stations, pet relief areas and nursing rooms. It is very updated and clean. 

The airport has a decent amount of food options and a couple of stores. Some of its restaurants include Popeyes, Emeril's Table, Lucky Dogs, Chick-fil-a, Shake Shack, Cafe du Monde, Auntie Anne's, and MoPho. There is a cell phone lot right across the street and there is also a decent sized paid parking garage.  The airport has cabs and ride sharing available. 

Rental car companies are not located in the airport. However, there is a shuttle that will take you to and from the rental car center, so plan accordingly. 

Fun fact: The airport averages 4.5 feet above sea level, making it the second lowest-lying international airport in the world.

I really like this new and improved airport. It is like the Ikea of airports. It can get a bit overwhelming during large events such as the Superbowl or Mardi though and it may be difficult to get a reasonably priced flight. I have had to go to Baton Rouge or Biloxi/Gulfport a couple of times for that reason. Anyway, the airport is alway improving and getting better. In the few years that I have been using the airport, they have made leaps and bounds. They have many more food options and amenities than they had when I first came through here. And the rental car facility is a vast improvement from the in terminal desks that they use to have.

You will enjoy flying in and out of here. It is very easy to do. The only problem is that the traffic sometimes get very backed up getting to the new terminal. Either way, this airport should be a template for other new airports to follow.",2021-12-20 02:17:45 UTC,5,0,0,1,4D7cJFScrGmyGxmCJIaRoA

Yes, we knew it'd be hot but we also know that all establishments have a/c and accommodate this issue. Not a problem. We decided to stay at the Monteleone after visiting the Carousel Bar many times during other visits. Our stay was wonderful except for one thing . . . the pool and area around the pool. More on that in a minute.

The hotel is exceptional in it's historic elements and location. It is central to everything in the French Quarter . . Is it outdated? Ya, maybe a bit tired. The rooms could use a refresh, but I get the old charm and appreciate it for what it is. The amenities are a bit more updated with a really nice modern workout area and spa. Front desk folks are exceptional and very helpful. The Carousel Bar is always fun, but so crowded that it's tough to get a seat right at the bar. The walls between rooms are very thin and we could hear the people next door talking at 2am.

Now to the pool. The pool is on the roof. Very cool, right? Nope. The pool is small which is fine considering it's on the roof. There is a nice bar area. Here's the problem . . . Did I mention we were there in July? Hot in NOLA in July, right? Right. We knew this and figured we could go up to the pool, relax and cool off. Nope. 

The pool was the biggest disaster and disappointment. Two major issues. First, there is NO shade at the pool unless you want to sit by the bar under the small building overhang area. If you want to sit in lounge chairs or be in the pool, you have to sit under the relentless blistering hot sun. Why aren't there any umbrellas? I understand that a wind could take them over the walls/fencing down into the street but maybe they could bolt them to the cement floor? I don't know, but there's got to be a way. 

Here's the best part . . . the pool is HEATED! This is fine if you're not there in summer, but the temps were in the mid 90s with the heat index around 107º. Seriously? Jumping into the pool for relief from the heat was the biggest disappointment. It was disgusting and cloudy and HOT, HOT, HOT!!! There was no relief from the sun or heat. I was told by the concierge that the heat had to stay on year-round to prevent bacteria and algae from forming. This seems ridiculous to me as there are plenty of unheated pools without this problem. This has to be fixed. Everyone at the pool area were talking about these issues.

Overall, I would recommend staying at the Hotel Monteleone. We will stay here again, although we will wait for cooler weather.",2021-07-27 15:27:45 UTC,4,0,0,2,xZ1-Yx1pb1jzDKknxwsmnw

This is a historic hotel full of stories and has been kept up very well over time. 

The room we stayed in was clean, kept up to date, and good quality. The air conditioning was great. The pillows were nice and soft. That bathroom shower pressure was awesome! This hotel also features a rooftop pool and pool bar. The pool bar does not except cash, but will either charge your purchase to the room or except card. They offer towels up there for guests, so no need to bring one from the room. The landscaping up there is nice. The gym is also up there near the pool. The gym has a decent selection of machines to work on and in excellent view of the quarter on both sides. Since we had so much to do in this city, we didn't get a chance to go to the famous carousel bar. That can be for another time.

Location is everything. Since this is right there in the French quarter, it was easy walking distance to everything do you want to see in this part of the city.

I changed our room with just mild difficulty to an upgraded room with no additional charge as we had stayed at the hotel in the recent past.  

The upgraded room was much nicer with a lovely view.  There was however construction going on in an adjacent room from 8:00 am on.  Room issues included black mold in the grout surrounding the bathtub, ripped bedding (very clean though), and not changing the sheets daily.  This is a major minus for me as just a little bit of effort would eradicate the mold and I do feel that sheets should be changed daily.   I think the carpeting throughout the hotel needs a serious cleaning. I also because of my allergies and asthma feel that the air conditioning needs a cleaning. I woke every morning congested with a headache.  I am however more sensitive than others to mold.  My son did not have an issue.  

Hotel staff, overall, was very, very pleasant.  Adorable really.  

The Criollo restaurant has a nice breakfast menu.  Our hostess was incredibly rude but we laughed it off.  Guess she was having a bad day.  Breakfast was delicious.  

$75 a day is charged upon arrival for any incidentals.  Check out was easy, but upon reviewing my statement I realized that I was charged an upgrade fee.   I had to go back and spend time to fix the error.  I can't help but wonder if they thought I would not notice.",2021-08-16 19:38:00 UTC,3,0,0,0,YfPNzzf6GJqT9f-Onvys_Q

To get in. I think they should have some sort of time and or system for hotel guests to get in ahead of other guests. There was also no room service due to covid so it was not easy to get breakfast or food off hours. Again if you weren't at restaurant early you were out of luck.

We were given a room on the 14th floor (the super haunted floor- rm 1464) so that was cool.
Nothing too crazy as far as ghost sightings go but I did wake twice due to what felt like the bed shaking. Not intensely or anything but almost like if you were on the ground level and a train were to drive by sending vibrations into the structure.

It took him two trips and 45 minutes to snake out a bar of soap and the plastic wrap that the soap was wrapped in. We did not do that and thought how odd that was. I went to the wet bar area and put our king cake on the counter where I found a wine glass with dried wine in the bottom of the glass. Now I am concerned. I called the front desk and I quickly sprayed everything down with Lysol and wiped all surfaces as we were tired wanted to go to bed. The next day we left at 11 am for the day I stopped by the front desk and told the front desk again and the gentleman said he had heard about it and I told him I thought a employee had maybe been in the room as the maids would surely have noticed the toilet being stopped up even if they missed the glass (however, with COVID, I find it very concerning that the housekeepers would not be more vigilant) and that the employee went to wash up went they were finished and knew they could not leave the soap out or throw it in the trash can, so they thought they flushed it. 
Where the problem comes in is I asked for them to please have housekeeping totally clean the room. We would be gone all day so it would be clear- he asked if I took do not disturb sign off door and I said I did. He reassured me that this was not how they clean the rooms and he would be sure it was cleaned. We returned at 7 and were shocked to find the most expensive room in the building had not been cleaned!! I checked to make sure I had taken the Do not Disturb sign down and it was on the table by the door. I called downstairs and told the front desk and she said she would call a manager. I asked for the room to be clean and she said she must call a manager. 45 mins later she called and said they could deliver towels but they did not have staff to clean the room this late. Wow. I spend $1500 a night and have basically been in a dirty room since I checked into the Earnest Hemingway Suite. And to further compound the situation they offer me a $300 discount. I have always adored this beautiful, iconic hotel- sadly I would recommend everyone to get the regular rooms. The nicer suite was not worth it if you have to clean and make the beds after walking around all day when you return.",2021-02-18 14:58:32 UTC,2,1,1,2,afklHM4_2W27MesZMwBg4w

Beautiful interiors. Nice rooms especially if you get a preferred room so that you have a view. We were here for a conference. The conference space was the perfect size for our group (about 40 people) and the accommodations were nice and staff were pleasant.

I docked a star mainly for an incident that affected our experience on our final full day of our visit. The side of the hotel that has the conference space is under construction. They are renovating to make luxury rooms which is cool. The only floors not under construction in this particular area of the hotel were floor 16-17 where our conference rooms were. The fire alarm went off and our group proceeded to evacuate. We went down 17 flights of stairs only to find out that it was a false alarm and it had only gone off in our conference room area. The rest of the hotel, including the staff were unaware that we had received an alarm and evacuated.... my poor 68 year old mother was hurting so bad after that many stairs that she had to go to bed and miss the rest of that day's speakers. Anyways the staff was apologetic to our group but it seems concerning that an alarm could go off without anyone knowing.

Only other bummer was the famous carousel bar. It has a line constantly throughout the say. My friend and I decided to get in line at 9:10 about 50 minutes before closing. We got up to the front of the line and were excited but then they came and told us right at 9:30 that it was last call and they wouldn't be seating anyone else. Maybe it's just because I'm from Las Vegas and things never close but a 9:30 last call is ridiculous and if they knew they weren't going to seat us they should have cut off the line sooner. There were probably 10+ people in line after us",2021-05-06 20:12:29 UTC,4,0,0,1,4gXY5N3BLJc5OYoZalvUVg

They have the location and they have the popularity; and they're even home to one of the most popular bars (The Carousel Bar)... 

But contrary to their very positive reviews from Travel Advisor and Google (with about 15,000 combined reviews), I found many things to be lacking. 

After years of visiting New Orleans, we've always loved the exterior (right down to the highly detailed facade and neon garage signage); the doormen are great at greeting with humor and making you feel at home. The lobby is elegant and for some it may feel dated but it's classic. The staff are awesome and accommodating. 

After years of staying at the same hotel in the Central Business District, we decided we wanted to stay in the French Quarter and based on all the above, we booked a room and were psyched.

It's worth noting that my gripes would never affect anyone visiting the hotel to drink on the famous merry-go-round at the Carousel Bar or eating at Criollo, but my disappointment was almost immediate upon entering my room... 

For one, I wasn't expecting a modern room but if a room is still retaining it's vintage/classic look it must still be inviting... unfortunately this felt dated immediately upon our entry. 

Then I noticed the drapes were closed in the middle of the day, so naturally I opened them for a little view and to let some light in, only to be staring at brick (no light and no view). Disappointing to say the least... and I couldn't find anything with online booking to know the view (such as city view). 

The bathroom was the last straw that pretty much solidified my dissatisfaction... the show had those really tacky florescent lights with the plastic covers and they were filthy. The ceiling had stains and the paint was chipping away The vanity and toilet are in serious need of replacement and the worst part of it all was it wasn't nearly as clean as it could've been. I NEED A CLEAN BATHROOM and our room wasn't. 

We stayed once and until I know they've updated the rooms, I don't think I'll be checking in anytime soon.",2021-10-31 11:17:13 UTC,3,1,1,7,8l_Q08hSib60K49uKVlngw

Southern hospitality is at its best here. The staff are warm, welcoming and caring. Dwight and Derek are the sweetest!!! They gave us tips, things to try and always wanted to hear about our adventures. True gentlemen.

The hotel rooms and amenities are impeccable. Our room was extremely clean, beds are very comfy and room service was pristine.

The food in hotel's restaurant, Criollo, is to die for...After my first meal, I told my mom I'm ready to move here! Since then, we came here several times for brunch and dinner. You must try their beignet with praline sauce. They're heavenly and addicting...

The pool was the perfect touch to our stay, especially since it was so hot and humid in July. No better way to unwind after exploring the city everyday.
